  <h1 class="sp3 ac" style="margin-bottom:6.4ex;"><span class="larger">PREFACE.</span></h1>

  <p>The object of this book is to give a general account of the various methods of writing, the
  different forms of manuscripts and the styles and systems of decoration that were used from the
  earliest times down to the sixteenth century <span class="smaller">A.D.</span>, when the invention
  of printing gradually put an end to the ancient and beautiful art of manuscript illumination.</p>

  <p>I have attempted to give a historical sketch of the growth and development of the various
  styles of manuscript illumination, and also of the chief technical processes which were employed
  in the preparation of pigments, the application of gold leaf, and other details, to which the most
  unsparing amount of time and labour was devoted by the scribes and illuminators of many different
  countries and periods.</p>

  <p>An important point with regard to this subject is the remarkable way in which technical
  processes lasted, in many cases, almost without alteration from classical times down to the latest
  mediaeval period, partly owing to the existence of an unbroken chain of <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagexiv">{xiv}</span>traditional practice, and partly on account of the mediaeval custom of
  studying and obeying the precepts of such classical writers as Vitruvius and Pliny the Elder.</p>

  <p>To an English student the art-history of illuminated manuscripts should be especially
  interesting, as there were two distinct periods when the productions of English illuminators were
  of unrivalled beauty and importance throughout the world<a id="NtA_1"
  href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>In the latter part of this volume I have tried to describe the conditions under which the
  illuminators of manuscripts did their work, whether they were monks who laboured in the
  <i>scriptorium</i> of a monastery, or members of some secular guild, such as the great painters'
  guilds of Bruges or Paris.</p>

  <p>The extraordinary beauty and marvellous technical perfection of certain classes of manuscripts
  make it a matter of interest to learn who the illuminators were, and under what daily conditions
  and for what reward they laboured with such astonishing patience and skill.</p>

  <p>The intense pleasure and refreshment that can be gained by the study of a fine mediaeval
  illuminated manuscript depend largely on the fact that the exquisite miniatures, borders and
  initial letters were the product of an age which in almost every respect differed widely from the
  unhappy, machine-driven nineteenth century in which we now live.</p>

  <p>With regard to the illustrations, I have to thank <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagexv">{xv}</span>Mr John Murray for his kindness in lending me a <i>cliché</i> of the
  excellent woodcut of the <i>scriptorium</i> walk in the cloisters of the Benedictine Abbey of
  Gloucester, which was originally prepared to illustrate one of Mr Murray's valuable <i>Guides to
  the English Cathedrals</i>.</p>

  <p>The rest of the illustrations I owe to the kindness of Mr Kegan Paul. They have previously
  appeared in the English edition of Woltmann and Woermann's valuable <i>History of Painting</i>,
  1880-7.</p>

  <p>I have to thank my friend and colleague Mr M. R. James for his kindness in looking through the
  proofs of this book. He is not responsible for the opinions expressed or for the errors that
  remain, but he has corrected some of the grosser blunders.</p>

  <p>Before entering upon any discussion of the styles and methods of decoration which are to be
  found in mediaeval manuscripts and of the various processes, pigments and other materials which
  were employed by the mediaeval illuminators it will be necessary to give some account of the
  shapes and kinds of books which were produced among various races during the classical period.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Survival of methods.</i></span>The reason of this is that classical
  styles of decoration and technical methods, in the preparation of paper, parchment, pigments and
  the like, both survived to greater extent and to a very much later period than is usually supposed
  to have been the case, and, indeed, continued to influence both the artistic qualities and the
  mechanical processes of the mediaeval illuminator almost down to the time when the production of
  illuminated manuscripts was gradually put an end to by the invention of printing.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>The pen and the stilus.</i></span>The word <i>manuscript</i> is
  usually taken to imply writing with a pen, brush or <i>stilus</i> to the exclusion of inscriptions
  cut with the chisel or the graver in stone, marble, bronze or other hard substance. The science of
  <i>palaeography</i> deals with the former, while <i>epigraphy</i> is concerned with the latter.
  The inscribed clay tablets of Assyria and Babylon might be considered a sort of link between the
  two, on account of the cuneiform writing on them having been executed with a stilus in soft,
  plastic clay, which subsequently was hardened by <span class="pagenum" id="page2">{2}</span>baking
  in the potter's kiln, but it will be needless to describe them here.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Writing on metal.</i></span><i>Manuscripts on metal plates.</i>
  Another form of writing especially used by the ancient Greeks, which falls more definitely under
  the head of manuscripts, consists of characters scratched with a sharp iron or bronze
  <i>stilus</i> on plates of soft tin, lead or pewter, which, when not in use, could be rolled up
  into a compact and conveniently portable cylinder.</p>

  <p>A considerable number of these inscribed lead rolls have been found in the tombs of Cyprus; but
  none of them unfortunately have as yet been found to contain matter of any great interest.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Lead rolls.</i></span>For the most part they consist either of
  monetary accounts, or else of formulae of imprecations, curses devoting some enemy to punishment
  at the hands of the gods. We know however from the evidence of classical writers that famous poems
  and other important literary works were occasionally preserved in the form of these inscribed tin
  or lead rolls. Pausanias, for example, tells us that during his visit to Helicon in Boeotia he was
  shown the original manuscript of Hesiod's <i>Works and Days</i> written on plates of lead; see
  Paus. <span class="smaller">IX.</span> 31. Again at <span class="smaller">IV.</span> 26, Pausanias
  records the discovery at Ithome in Messenia of a bronze urn (<i>hydria</i>) which contained a
  manuscript of the "Mysteries of the Great Deities" written on <span class="leftmar"><i>Tin
  rolls.</i></span>"a thinly beaten plate of tin, which was rolled up like a book," <span

  This  method of writing would be quite different from the laborious method of cutting inscriptions
  on bronze plates with a chisel and hammer, or with a graver.</p>

  <p>A scribe could write on the soft white metal with a sharp stilus almost as easily and rapidly
  as if he were using pen and ink on paper, and the manuscript thus produced would have the
  advantage of extreme durability.</p>

  <p>We may indeed hope that even now some priceless lost work of early Greece may be recovered by
  the discovery of similar lead rolls to those which Cesnola found in Cyprus.</p>

  no longer wanted, a fresh surface for writing was prepared either by smoothing down the wax with
  the handle of the stilus, or else by scraping it off and pouring in a fresh supply. This is
  mentioned by Ovid (<i>Ar. Am.</i> <span class="smaller">I.</span> 437); "cera ... rasis infusa
  <span class="pagenum" id="page6">{6}</span>tabellis<a id="NtA_6" href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>."
  These tablets were sometimes called briefly <i>cerae</i>; the phrases <i>prima cera</i>, <i>altera
  cera</i>, meaning the first page, the second page. The best sorts of wooden writing-tablets were
  made of box-wood, and hence they are sometimes called <span title="pyxion"
  class="fsn">&pi;&upsilon;&xi;&#x1F77;&omicron;&nu;</span>. In addition to the holes along one edge
  of each tablet through which the cord or wire was passed to hold the leaves together and to form
  the hinge, additional holes were often made along the opposite edge in order that the letter or
  other writing on the <i>tabulae</i> might be kept private by tying a thread through these holes
  and then impressing a seal on the knot. Plautus (<i>Bacch.</i> <span class="smaller">IV.</span>

  Before passing on to describe other forms of classical manuscripts, it may be interesting to note
  that the ancient waxed tablets or <i>pugillares</i> continued to be used for certain purposes
  throughout the whole mediaeval period, down to the sixteenth century or even later. Many of the
  principal churches, especially in Italy, but also in other countries, possessed one or more
  diptychs on which were inscribed the names of all those who had in any way been benefactors either
  to the ecclesiastical foundation or to the building. In early times, during the daily celebration
  of Mass, the list of names was read out from the <i>diptych</i> by the Deacon standing in the
  gospel ambon; and the congregation was requested or "bid" to pray for the souls of those whose
  names they had just heard.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar">"<i>Bidding the beads.</i>"</span>The "bidding prayer" before University
  sermon at Oxford and Cambridge is a survival of this custom, which in the fifteenth century was
  termed "bidding the beads," that is "praying for the prayers" of the congregation. In some cases
  fine specimens of the old ivory <i>Consular diptychs</i> were used for this purpose in Italian
  churches till comparatively late times, but as a rule they fell into disuse before the eleventh or
  twelfth century, as the list of names became too long for the waxed leaves of a diptych, and so by
  degrees vellum rolls or else <i>codices</i>, often beautifully written in gold and silver letters,
  were substituted. One of the most splendid of these lists, the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page8">{8}</span><i>Liber vitae</i> of Durham, is now preserved in the British Museum;
  <i>Cotton manuscripts</i>, Domit. 7. 2.</p>

  <p>For many other purposes, both ecclesiastical and secular, the classical waxed tablets were used
  in England and on the Continent, especially for lists of names, as for example in great Cathedral
  or Abbey churches the list for the week of the various priests who were appointed to celebrate
  each mass at each of the numerous altars.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>List of guild-members.</i></span>The British Museum possesses a very
  interesting late example of a waxed tablet which in shape, size and general appearance is exactly
  like the Roman <i>pugillares</i>. This is an oak tablet, about 20 inches long by 10 inches wide,
  covered with a thin layer of wax protected by the usual slightly raised margin about half an inch
  wide. Along one edge are three holes with leather loops to form the hinges; the other leaf is
  lost. On the wax is inscribed a list of the names of the members of a Flemish guild; each name is
  still as sharp and legible as the day it was written. The form of the writing shows that it
  belongs to the end of the fifteenth century. Such tablets were used both by the trade guilds of
  the middle ages and by the religious guilds formed for the cult of some special Saint.</p>

  <i>Forum Pacis</i>. The sixth and largest of all was the double library, for Greek and Latin books
  built by Trajan in his Forum close to the <i>Basilica Ulpia</i>. To some extent a classification

  were decorated in a similar way, but with reliefs of less costly materials. A very interesting
  example of this has recently been discovered and then destroyed on the Esquiline hill in Rome. The
  house in which this library was discovered was one of no very exceptional size or splendour. The
  <i>bibliotheca</i> itself consisted of a handsome room; the lower part of its walls, against which
  the <i>armaria</i> fitted, was left quite plain. Above that the walls were divided into square
  panels by small fluted pilasters, <span class="leftmar"><i>Authors' busts.</i></span>and in the
  centre of each space there was, or had been, a medallion relief-portrait about two feet in
  diameter enclosed in a moulded frame. All this was executed in fine, hard marble-dust stucco
  (<i>opus albarium</i> or <i>marmoreum</i>).</p>

  <p>The names of the authors whose portraits had filled the medallions were written in red upon the
  frames. Only one was legible&mdash;<span class="smaller">APOLLONIVS THYAN</span>.... No doubt the
  works of Apollonius of Thyana were kept in the <i>armarium</i> below the bust.</p>

  <p>The library at Herculaneum, which contained the famous papyrus rolls, was a much smaller room.
  Besides the bookcases all round the walls, it had also an isolated <i>armarium</i> in the centre
  of the room; and this, no doubt, was a usual arrangement.</p>

  <p>The room at Herculaneum was so small that there can only have been just enough space to walk

  <p>Little capital would be required for the education of the <span class="pagenum"

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Papyrus plant.</i></span>The papyrus plant, the <i>Cyperus Papyrus</i>
  of Linnaeus, (Greek <span title="byblos" class="fsn">&beta;&#x1F7B;&beta;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>)
  is a very tall, handsome variety of reed which grows in marshes and shallows along the sides of
  streams of <span class="pagenum" id="page22">{22}</span>water. The plant has at the top a very
  graceful tufted bunch of foliage; its stem averages from three to four inches in diameter, and the
  total height of the plant is from ten to twelve feet.</p>

  <p>It grows in many places in Syria, in the Euphrates valley and in Nubia. In Egypt itself it is
  now extinct, but it was abundant there in ancient times, especially in the Delta of the Nile.</p>

  <p>The only spot in Europe where the papyrus plant grows in a wild state is near Syracuse in the
  little river Anapus, where it was probably introduced by the Arab conquerors in the eighth or
  ninth century <span class="smaller">A.D.</span></p>

  <p>It grows here in great abundance and sometimes nearly blocks up the stream so that a boat can
  scarcely get along.</p>

  <p>The stem of the papyrus consists of a soft, white, spongy or cellular pith surrounded by a
  thin, smooth, green rind. Papyrus paper (<span title="biblia"
  class="fsn">&beta;&iota;&beta;&lambda;&#x1F77;&alpha;</span> or <span title="chartês"
  class="fsn">&chi;&#x1F71;&rho;&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;</span>) was wholly made from the cellular pith.
  The method of manufacture was as follows.</p>

  </table>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Process of manufacture.</i></span>The long stem of the plant was first
  cut up into convenient pieces of a foot or more in length; the pith in each piece was then very
  carefully and evenly cut with a sharp knife into thin slices. These slices were then laid side by
  side, their edges touching but not overlapping, on the smooth surface of a wooden table which was
  slightly inclined to let the superfluous sap run off, as it was squeezed out of the slices of pith
  by gentle blows from a smooth wooden mallet. When by repeated beating the layer of pith had been
  hammered down to a thinner substance, and a great deal of the sap had drained off, some fine paste
  made of wheat-flour was carefully brushed over the whole surface of the pith. A second layer of
  slices of pith, previously prepared by beating, was then laid crosswise on the first layer made
  adhesive by the paste, so that the slices in the second layer were at right angles to those of the
  first. The beating process was then repeated, the workmen being careful to get rid of all lumps or
  inequalities, and the beating was continued till the various slices of pith in the two layers were
  thoroughly united and amalgamated together.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Use of many layers.</i></span>For the best sort of papyrus these
  processes were repeated <span class="pagenum" id="page23">{23}</span>a third and sometimes even a
  fourth time, the separate slices in each layer being cut much thinner than in the coarser sorts of
  paper which consisted of two layers only. The next process was to dry and press the paper; after
  which its surface was carefully smoothed and polished with an ivory burnisher<a id="NtA_17"
  href="#Nt_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>; its rough edges were trimmed, and it was then ready to be made
  up into sheets or rolls. There was nothing in the method of manufacture to limit strictly the size
  of the papyrus sheets (<span title="selides" class="fsn">&sigma;&epsilon;&lambda;&#x1F77;&delta;&epsilon;&sigmaf;</span>,
  <i>paginae</i>) either in breadth or length; <span class="leftmar"><i>Sizes of
  papyrus.</i></span>the workmen could lay side by side as many slices of the pith as he liked, and
  slices of great length might have been cut out of the long stem of the <i>papyrus</i>.
  Practically, however, it was found convenient to make the paper in rather small sheets; twelve to
  sixteen inches are the usual widths of papyrus manuscripts.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Union of the sheets.</i></span>The reason of this obviously was that
  it would have been impossible to cut slices of great length to the requisite thinness and evenness
  of substance, and so papyrus manuscripts are always made up of a large number of separate sheets
  carefully pasted together. This was very skilfully done by workmen who (in Pliny's time) were
  called <i>glutinatores</i>; cf. Cic. <i>Att.</i> <span class="smaller">IV.</span> 4. The two
  adjacent edges of the sheets, which were to be joined together by lapping, were thinned down by
  careful rubbing to about half their original substance. The two laps were then brushed over with
  paste, accurately applied together, and the union was then completed by beating with the wooden
  mallet. When the pasted joint was dry it was rubbed and polished with the ivory burnisher till
  scarcely any mark of the joining remained. <span class="leftmar"><i>Long rolls.</i></span>In this
  way long rolls were formed, often fifty feet or more in length; as a rule, however, excessive
  length for a single roll was inconvenient. Pliny mentions 20 sheets as being an ordinary limit.
  Thus, for example, in such works as Homer's <i>Iliad</i> or Virgil's <i>Aeneid</i>, each
  <i>book</i> would form a separate <i>volumen</i> or roll (Greek <span title="kylindros"

  title="tomos" class="fsn">&tau;&#x1F79;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>).</p>

  <p>The invention of papyrus paper dates from an early period in the history of Egypt. Examples
  still exist which <span class="pagenum" id="page24">{24}</span>are as early as 2300 <span

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Papyrus made in Rome.</i></span>In Pliny's time paper was made not
  only in Egypt but also in Rome and at other places in Italy<a id="NtA_18"
  href="#Nt_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a>. The best kind was formerly called <i>Hieratica</i>, because it
  was used in Egypt for sacred hieroglyphic writing only. In later times this finest quality, in
  Rome at least, was called <i>Augusta</i>, and the second quality <i>Liviana</i>, from Livia the
  wife of Augustus. A coarse variety used for wrapping up parcels and the like was called
  "shop-paper," <i>emporetica</i>. Pliny also tells us that paper was manufactured of many different
  breadths, varying from about four to eighteen inches. The commonest width was about twelve inches;
  see Pliny, <i>Hist. Nat.</i> <span class="smaller">XIII.</span> 71 to 83. <span
  class="leftmar"><i>Old MSS. on papyrus.</i></span>In the last of these paragraphs Pliny mentions
  examples of old papyrus manuscripts existing in his time, such as manuscripts in the handwriting
  of Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus, which were nearly two centuries old. Manuscripts written by
  Cicero, Augustus and Virgil are, he says, still frequently to be seen.</p>

  <p>With regard to the antiquity of paper Pliny's views are far from correct. He thinks paper was
  first made in Egypt in the time of Alexander the Great (<i>Hist. Nat.</i> <span
  class="smaller">XIII.</span> 79), whereas, as is mentioned above, papyrus paper of fine quality
  was certainly made in Egypt nearly 2000 years before the time of Alexander, and probably much

  refinement and delicacy of touch. To prevent the ink spreading or soaking into the paper, it was
  as a final process sometimes soaked in size made of fish-bones or gum and water, exactly as modern
  linen paper is sized. The colour of the papyrus is a pale brown, very pleasant to the eye, and
  excellent as a background to the painted decorations.</p>

  of papyrus paper; and these regular lines served as a guide to the scribe when writing, so that
  when papyrus was used it was not necessary to cover the page with ruled lines to keep the writing
  even, as had to be done when the manuscript was on vellum.</p>

  as the core of the roll; and the end of the long strip of papyrus by the last page or column of
  text was pasted on to it. The ends of the <i>umbilicus</i> were often fitted with a round knob or
  boss, which was decorated with gilding or colour. The edges of the papyrus roll were smoothed with
  pumice-stone (<i>pumice mundus</i>), and the whole manuscript was often provided with a vellum

  to the text in the characteristic mediaeval fashion. The mediaeval method, by often introducing
  miniature paintings within the boundary of large initial letters, and by surrounding the page with
  borders of foliage which grow out of the <span class="pagenum" id="page34">{34}</span>chief
  initials of the text, makes the decoration an essential part of the whole and creates a close
  union between the literary and the ornamental parts of the book, <span

  <i>Iliad</i> which are preserved in the Biblioteca Ambrogiana in Milan.</p>

  <p>These fragments consist of fifty-eight miniature paintings, which have been cut out of a folio
  manuscript on vellum of Homer's <i>Iliad</i>, dating probably from the latter part of the fourth
  century <span class="smaller">A.D.</span> The mutilator of this <i>codex</i> seems only to have

  hundred not consecutive lines which happen to be written on the backs of the paintings. Great
  additional interest is given to this priceless fragment by the fact that the miniatures are much

  one back further still; their rhythmical composition, the dignity of their motives, the simplicity
  of the planes, and the general largeness of style which is specially noticeable in some of the
  miniatures representing fighting armies of gods and heroes, all suggest that we have here a

  possess a gracefulness of pose and beauty of form which was far beyond the conception of any
  fourth century artist.</p>

  <p>It should, however, be observed that a fine Hellenic origin is not suggested by all the

  each deity's head, and different colours are used to distinguish them. The nimbus of Zeus is
  purple, that of Venus is green; those of the other gods are mostly blue. To a large extent the

  selected a picture which might by omissions and modifications be adapted to his subject; and for

  midway between the East and the West, the styles and technique of both met and were fused into a
  new stylistic development of the most remarkable kind. Western Europe, Asia Minor, Persia and
  Egypt all contributed elements both of design and of technical skill, which combined to create the
  new and for a while vigorously flourishing school of Byzantine art. The dull lifeless forms of
  Roman art in its extreme degradation <span class="pagenum" id="page46">{46}</span>were again
  quickened into new life and beauty in the hands of these Byzantine craftsmen, who became as it

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Monotony of style.</i></span>Before describing the characteristics of
  Byzantine illuminated manuscripts it may be well to note that the Byzantine style is unique in the
  artistic history of the world from the manner in which it rapidly was crystallized into rigidly
  fixed forms, and then continued for century after century with marvellously little modification or
  development either in colour, drawing or composition.</p>

  <p>This absence of any real living development was due to the fact that paintings of all kinds in
  the Eastern Church, from a colossal mural picture down to a manuscript miniature, were produced by
  ecclesiastics and for the Church, under a strictly applied series of hieratic rules.</p>

  </table>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Hieratic rules.</i></span>The drawing, the pose, the colours of the
  drapery of every Saint, and the scheme of composition of all sacred figure subjects came gradually
  to be defined by ecclesiastic rules, which each painter was bound to obey. Thus it happens that
  during the many centuries which are covered by the Byzantine style of art, though there are
  periods of decay and revival of artistic skill, yet in style there is the most remarkable
  monotony. This makes it specially difficult to judge from internal evidence of the date of a
  Byzantine painting. In manuscripts the palaeographic, not the artistic evidence, is the best
  guide, aided of course by various small technical peculiarities, and also by the amount of skill
  and power of drawing which is displayed in the paintings.</p>

  consists of twenty-four leaves of purple-dyed vellum, illuminated with miniatures on both sides.
  In the main the designs are feeble in composition and weak in drawing, belonging rather to the
  latest decadence of Roman classical art than to the yet undeveloped Byzantine style, which was
  soon to grow into great artistic spirit and strong decorative power, a completely new birth of
  aesthetic conceptions, the brilliance of which is the more striking from its following so closely
  on the degraded, lifeless, worn-out art of the Western Empire. In this manuscript of
  <i>Genesis</i> there is but little promise of the Renaissance that was so near at hand. <span
  class="leftmar"><i>Weak drawing.</i></span>The drawing of each figure, though sometimes graceful
  in pose, is rather weak, and the painter has hardly aimed at anything like real composition; his
  figures merely stand in long rows, with little or nothing to group them together. Fig. <a

  accusation of Joseph by Potiphar's wife. In every way this <i>Genesis</i> manuscript forms a

  <i>mandragora</i> (mandrake). The dying dog refers to the popular belief, given by Josephus, as to
  the manner in which the mandrake was gathered. When plucked from the ground the mandrake uttered a
  scream which caused the death of any living creature that heard it; it was therefore usual to tie
  a dog to the plant and retire to a safe distance before calling it, and so causing the dog to drag

  art, that of the worker in enamelled gold, an art which was practised in Constantinople with
  wonderful taste and skill. The kind of enamel which was so often imitated by the manuscript
  illuminator is now called cloisonné enamel from the thin slips of gold or <i>cloisons</i> which
  separate one colour from another, and mark out the chief lines of the design. So closely did many
  of the illuminators copy designs in this cloisonné that very often one sees manuscript miniatures
  which look at first sight as if they were actual pieces of enamel. In other ways too the art of
  the goldsmith had considerable influence on Byzantine illuminations; and the designs of the
  mosaic-worker and the miniaturist acted and reacted upon each other, so that we sometimes see an
  elaborate painting in a book which looks like a design for a wall-mosaic; or again the gorgeous

  Indopleustes</i> in the Vatican library (No. 699) is of the pure and fully developed Byzantine
  style, with its formal attitudes, its rigid drapery, its lengthy proportions of figure, and stiff
  monotonous schemes of composition, such as grew to be accepted as the one sacred style, and as
  such has been preserved by the Eastern Church down to the present century.</p>

  <p>This manuscript of Cosmas is certainly a work of Justinian's time, the first half of the sixth

  fifteenth century <i>Books of Hours</i>. Next comes the fifth miniature representing "Christ in
  Majesty," usually enthroned within an oval or vesica-shaped aureole; He sits on a rainbow, and at
  His feet is a globe to represent the earth, or in some cases a small figure of <i>Tellus</i> or

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Weak drawing of the figure.</i></span>Returning now to the general
  question of the style of Byzantine art, it should be observed that, though little knowledge of the
  human form is shown by the miniaturists, yet they were able to produce highly dignified
  compositions, very strong in decorative effect. Study of the nude form was strictly prohibited by
  the Church; and the beauty of the human figure was regarded as a snare and a danger to minds <span
  class="pagenum" id="page57">{57}</span>which should be fixed upon the imaginary glories of another
  world. What grace and dignity there is in Byzantine figure painting depends chiefly on the skilful
  treatment of the drapery with simple folds modelled in gracefully curving lines.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Livid flesh colour.</i></span>The utmost splendour of gold and colour
  is lavished on this drapery, and on the backgrounds, border-frames and other accessories, while
  the colouring of the flesh, in faces, hands and feet, is commonly unpleasant; with, in many cases,
  an excessive use of green in the shadows, which gives an unhealthy look to the faces. This copious
  use of green in flesh tints is especially apparent in the later Byzantine paintings, and again in
  the Italian imitations of Byzantine art. Even paintings by Cimabue and some of his followers, in
  the second half of the thirteenth century, are disfigured by the flesh in shadow being largely
  painted with <i>terra verde</i><a id="NtA_43" href="#Nt_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Monastic bigotry.</i></span>The monastic bigotry, which prohibited
  study either of the living model or of the beauties of classical sculpture, tended to foster a
  strongly conventional element in Art, which for certain decorative purposes was of the highest
  possible value. Anything like realism is quite unsuited both for colossal mural frescoes or
  mosaics and for miniature paintings in an illuminated manuscript.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Splendour of MSS.</i></span>One important characteristic of the
  Carolingian manuscripts is their extreme splendour. The freely used burnished gold is often made
  more magnificent by the contrast of no less brilliant silver. Purple-stained vellum was largely
  used, and all the pigments are of the most gorgeous hues that great technical skill could produce.
  And yet in spite of all this magnificence of shining metals and bright colours the effect is never
  harsh or gaudy, owing to the taste and judgment shown by the illuminators in the way they broke up
  their colours, avoiding large unrelieved masses, and in the arrangement of the colours so as to
  give a general effect of harmony in spite of the great chromatic force of the separate parts.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Technical methods.</i></span>The somewhat realistic way of
  representing the Evangelists as aged white-haired men, which occurs in Byzantine manuscripts, in
  the Carolingian <i>Gospels</i> is replaced by a more conventional treatment, and thus they are as
  a rule represented as youthful, beardless men of an idealized type. The general treatment of the
  figure is flat, with little or no light and shade or modelling of any kind. The drapery is
  represented by strong, dark lines applied over a flatly laid wash of pigment. The painter first
  drew in his outlines with a fine brush dipped in red, and then filled in the intermediate spaces
  with a wash of colour mixed with a large proportion of gummy medium, so that a very glossy,
  lustrous surface was produced. The folds of the drapery and the rest of the internal drawing of
  the figures were put in after the application of the flat ground colour. This method very much
  resembles the process of the early Greek vase-painters. In order to give richness of effect by the
  use of a thick body of colour the illuminator commonly applied his flat tints in two or even three
  distinct washes, a method which is recommended by Theophilus<a id="NtA_50"

  observation and even careful study of the actual life and movement which the painters saw around
  them. In this curious class of manuscripts, though the figure subjects are devoid of much vigour

  We are told by the Venerable Bede that the Irish monks had learnt how to extract this beautiful
  dye from a variety of the <i>murex</i> shell-fish which is not uncommon on both shores of the
  Irish Channel. Splendid as they are in colour, there is one curious feature in the early Irish
  manuscripts of the finest class, such as the <i>Book of Kells</i>; that is, that no gold or silver
  either in the form of leaf or as a fluid pigment is used. This seems specially strange when we

  Lindisfarne as the head-quarters of his missionary church, which, at first consisting mainly of a

  Bishop and Abbot of Lindisfarne, was able to establish a number of monastic houses throughout the

  eighth Bishop of Lindisfarne (698 to 721), was the writer of these <i>Gospels</i>, "in honour of

  Northumbria, and there took ship for Ireland. A great storm, however, arose; their boat shipped a
  heavy sea which washed overboard the precious Gospels of Saint Cuthbert, which had been carefully
  packed in a wooden box. Eventually the little ship was driven back, and finally was stranded on
  the Northumbrian shore. Soon after reaching the land the fugitive monks, wandering sadly along the
  beach, found, to their great joy, the lost box with its precious manuscript thrown up by the waves
  and lying on dry land. According to the chronicle of Symeon<a id="NtA_68"

  transplantation to English soil. The intermediate stage in Iona and other monasteries of western

  Whether produced in eastern Ireland or in western Scotland the manuscripts were the work of the

  the not very distant shores of northern Britain to which these Irish settlers gave the name

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Improved drawing.</i></span>When however the Irish monks passed from
  Iona to Northumbria the case was different; they were surrounded with a new set of artistic
  influences mainly owing to the introduction into Northumbria of fine Byzantine and Italian
  manuscripts. The result of this was that though the Lindisfarne manuscripts continued to be
  decorated with exactly the same class of patterns that had been used in the <i>Book of Kells</i>
  and other Irish manuscripts for initials, borders and the like, yet in the treatment of the human
  figure a very distinct advance was made. Thus in Saint Cuthbert's <i>Gospels</i> the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page89">{89}</span>seated figures of the Evangelists are drawn with much
  dignity of form and with some attempt at truth in the pose, the proportions and in the disposition

  him some fine manuscripts of the Gospels probably both of Byzantine and Italian style.</p>

  monastic illuminators worked hard at the production of manuscripts and spread the Celtic style of

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>The two Churches in Britain.</i></span>Returning now to the
  manuscripts of the Celtic Church in Northumbria, in order to understand the gradual introduction
  into Northern England of the Italian or classical style of painting it is necessary to remember
  the struggle which took place during the seventh century between the adherents of the older Celtic
  Church and those who supported the Papal claims for supremacy throughout Britain.</p>

  <p>On the one hand the See of Canterbury, founded by the Roman Saint Augustine, claimed
  jurisdiction in the north as well as in the south of Britain, in opposition to the Celtic Abbot of
  Iona, who was then the real Metropolitan of the Church in the north of England.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Long struggle.</i></span>Wilfrid of York and Benedict Biscop of Jarrow
  spent many years in a series of embassies, between 670 and 690, backward and forward between
  Northumbria and Rome striving to introduce the Papal authority, by the aid of imported books,
  relics and craftsmen skilled in building stone churches in place of the simple wooden structures
  which at that time were the only ecclesiastical buildings in Northumbria<a id="NtA_80"
  href="#Nt_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a>. Very large numbers of illuminated manuscripts were brought to
  England during the many journeys of Wilfrid and Benedict Biscop; and important libraries were
  created at York and at Jarrow which led to these places becoming literary and artistic centres of
  great and European importance.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Synod of Whitby.</i></span>In the end, after many failures, Wilfrid,
  Archbishop<a id="NtA_81" href="#Nt_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a> of York, was successful in bringing
  Northumbria under the supremacy of Canterbury and Rome. In 664 a great Council was held at Whitby
  in the presence of the Northumbrian King Oswiu. Bishop Colman, the successor of Saint Aidan at
  Lindisfarne, represented the Celtic Church and the authority of Saint Columba, while Wilfrid
  appeared to support the authority <span class="pagenum" id="page96">{96}</span>of Saint Peter and
  the Bishop of Rome. After hearing that Saint Peter possessed the keys of Heaven and Hell, <span
  class="leftmar"><i>Defeat of the Celtic party.</i></span>while Saint Columba could claim no such
  marvellous power, King Oswiu decided in favour of the Roman Supremacy. This decision, though based
  on such fanciful grounds, was a fortunate one for the English Church, since, in the main,
  learning, culture and established order generally were on the side of the Italian Church.</p>

  <p>The practical result of this Roman victory at the Synod of Whitby in 664 was that a classical
  influence gradually extended itself in all the English centres for the production of illuminated
  manuscripts. It has already been noted that the splendid manuscripts of Lindisfarne and other
  Northumbrian monasteries, though of Celtic origin, show a distinct Roman influence in the
  improvement of the drawing of their figures of Saints. By degrees the Irish element in the
  illuminations grew less and less; though the interlaced patterns and fantastic dragon and serpent
  forms lasted for many centuries in all the chief countries of western Europe and form an important
  decorative element till the thirteenth century<a id="NtA_82"

  throughout the whole length and breadth of the land. In Northumbria the thriving literary and
  artistic school which had been raised to such preeminence by Baeda was utterly blotted out from
  existence by the invading Danes; and when at last King Alfred, who reigned from 871 to 901,
  secured an interval of peace he was obliged to seek instructors in the art of manuscript
  illumination from the Frankish kings.</p>

  manuscripts had been largely influenced by the Celtic style, which Alcuin of York introduced from
  Northumbria, and now the later art of Anglo-Saxon England received back from France the forms of
  ornament and the technical skill which in Northumbria itself had become extinct.</p>

  <p>Alfred was an enthusiastic patron of literature and art, especially the art of manuscript
  illumination, and before long a new school of manuscript art was created in many of the <span

  984<a id="NtA_86" href="#Nt_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a>. The writer of this sumptuously decorated
  manuscript was Bishop Aethelwold's chaplain, a monk named Godemann, who afterwards, about the year
  970, became Abbot of Thorney. Unlike the manuscripts of earlier date in which the illuminated
  pictures are usually few in number, this <i>Benedictional</i> contains no less than thirty full
  page miniatures, mostly consisting of scenes from the life of Christ. Each picture is framed by an
  elaborate border, richly decorated in gold and brilliant colours, with conventional leaf-work of
  classical style. The drawing of the figures is dignified, and the drapery is usually well
  conceived and treated in a bold, decorative way, showing much artistic skill on the part of the
  illuminator.</p>

  and brilliant colours on a purple-stained leaf of vellum<a id="NtA_88"

  Edgar in the middle offering his charter to Christ. The whole picture is very skilfully designed
  so as to fill the whole page in the most decorative way, and it is framed in a border with richly
  devised conventional leaf-forms.</p>

  <p>In artistic power this tenth century Winchester school of illuminators appears, for a while at

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Coloured ink drawings.</i></span>During the tenth century a large

  Anglo-Carolingian <span class="pagenum" id="page102">{102}</span>style, as represented by the
  magnificent <i>Benedictional</i> of Aethelwold. This class of illumination consists of drawings,
  often with a large number of small figures, executed with a pen in red, blue and brown outline.
  The drawing of these figures is very mannered, the heads are small, the attitudes awkward, and the
  draperies are represented in numerous small, fluttering folds, drawn with an apparently shaky
  line, as if the artist had lacked firmness of hand. This, however, is a mere mannerism, as
  wherever he wished for a steady line, as, for example, in the drawing of the faces, the artist has
  drawn with the utmost decision and firmness of touch. The costumes of these curious outline
  drawings, the architectural accessories and other details, all show clearly the influence of the
  very debased forms of classical Roman art, which still survived among the manuscript illuminations
  of Italy<a id="NtA_90" href="#Nt_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a>. This degraded form of classical art was
  far from being a good model for the Anglo-Saxon illuminator to imitate, and the blue and red

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>MSS. of the XIIth century.</i></span>In the eleventh century
  Anglo-Saxon miniatures in coloured outline improved greatly in beauty of form and in gracefulness

  produced. A very beautiful example of this is a long vellum roll illuminated with eighteen
  circular miniatures, mostly drawn with a pen in dark brown ink. <span class="leftmar"><i>Roll of
  St Guthlac.</i></span>These outline miniatures represent scenes from the life of Saint Guthlac,
  the Hermit of Crowland. The series begins with a drawing of the youthful Guthlac receiving the
  tonsure from Hedda, Bishop of Winchester (676 to 705), in the presence of the Abbess Ebba and two
  nuns. The whole composition is very skilfully arranged to fill the circular medallion, and there
  is great dignity and even delicate beauty in the separate figures. The precision of <span
  class="pagenum" id="page103">{103}</span>touch shown in the drawing is most admirable, <span
  class="leftmar"><i>Beauty of line.</i></span>recalling the perfect purity of line seen in the
  finest vase-paintings of the Greeks, in which, as in these miniatures, the greatest amount of
  effect is produced with the fewest possible touches. A few flat washes are introduced into the
  backgrounds, but all the principal part of the miniatures is executed with this pure outline.</p>

  <p>There are no grounds for the suggestion that these medallion drawings were intended as designs
  for stained glass. There is much similarity of style in stained glass paintings and manuscript
  illuminations during the twelfth to the fourteenth century in England, just as in the early
  Byzantine manuscripts the same design serves for a miniature painting and a colossal wall-mosaic.
  The same simplicity of drawing and flatness of composition were preserved in both classes of art,
  and there is nothing exceptional in the fact that these miniatures of Saint Guthlac might have
  served as excellent motives for a glass-painter<a id="NtA_91"

  With a view to fostering the production of fine illuminated manuscripts he introduced into this

  wall-paintings, with subjects from sacred and profane history and from the Apocryphal books of the
  Old Testament, were executed by various artists, both monks and laymen, on the walls of the chief

  an illuminated manuscript of the time; they were simply designed, flat in treatment, and executed
  with the most minute and delicate detail. Great richness of effect was produced by the use of
  wooden stamps with which delicate diapers and other patterns were stamped over the backgrounds of
  the pictures on the thin coat of <i>gesso</i> which covered the stone wall. These minutely
  executed reliefs were then thickly gilt, forming rich gold backgrounds, such as are so commonly

  miniatures, using the designs to paint the walls of "the Queen's low room in the new Palace of

  Westminster Palace, decorated with a marvellous series of exquisitely finished paintings, was
  known as "the Painted Chamber" <i>par excellence</i> from its great size and the immense number of
  pictures which covered its walls. The system of decoration adopted in the thirteenth century was
  not to paint large pictures in a large hall, but simply to multiply the number of small ones,
  keeping the figures as delicate in execution and small in scale as if the room had been of the
  most limited dimensions.</p>

  <p>This had the effect of enormously adding to the apparent scale of the room, a great contrast to
  the method of decoration which was employed in later times of decadence, when large halls were
  dwarfed and rendered insignificant by covering the walls with figures of colossal size. The
  sixteenth century tapestry in the great hall at Hampton Court is a striking example of the way in
  which gigantic figures may destroy the scale of an interior.</p>

  especially on English soil, had reached a higher pitch of perfection, aesthetic and technical,
  than had been then attained by any other country in the world. In the fourteenth and fifteenth

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Method of execution.</i></span>The miniatures of this school are

  silver point; the main masses are then put in with flat, solid colour; the internal drawing of the
  folds of the drapery, the hair and features and the like, are then added with a delicate pointed
  brush, capable of drawing the finest possible line; and finally some shading is added to give
  roundness to the forms, especially of the drapery, a broader touch being used for this, unlike the
  first drawing of the details, which is executed with a thin, though boldly applied line. As a rule
  the portions which are in shadow are put in with a pure pigment; the high lights being represented
  with white, and the half lights with a mixture of white and the same pigment that is used for the
  dark shadows. By this somewhat conventional system of colouring, the local colour is never lost,
  and the whole effect is highly decorative, and far more suitable for painting on such a minute

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Horae of the Duc de Berri.</i></span>The Paris library possesses
  (<i>Bibl. Nat.</i> Lat. 919) a very magnificent manuscript <i>Horae</i>, which was painted for the
  Duc de Berri at the beginning of the century by a French miniaturist named Jaquemart de Odin. At
  the Duke's death this <i>Book of Hours</i> was valued at no less than four thousand livres
  Tournois, equal in modern value to quite two thousand pounds. It is mentioned thus in the
  inventory of the Duke's personal property, <i>item, unes tres belles heures tres richement
  enluminees et hystoriees de la main de Jaquemart de Odin....</i> Like all books of this class,
  specially painted for a distinguished person, the arms and badges of the owner are introduced
  among the foliated ornaments of the borders of many pages; as the inventory states, <i>par les

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Architectural framing.</i></span>One special beauty of French
  illumination of this date is due to the exquisite treatment of architectural frames and
  backgrounds which are used to enshrine the whole picture. The loveliest Gothic forms are
  introduced, with the most delicate detail of tracery, pinnacles, canopy-work, shafts and arches,
  all being frequently executed in gold with subtle transparent shading to give an effect of relief.
  From the technical point of view these manuscripts reach the highest pitch of perfection; the
  burnished gold is thick and solid in appearance, and is convex in surface so as to catch high
  lights, and look, not like gold leaf, but like actual plates of the purest and most polished
  gold<a id="NtA_130" href="#Nt_130"><sup>[130]</sup></a>. The pigments are of the most brilliant
  colours, so skilfully prepared and applied that they are able to defy the power of time to change
  their hue or even dim their splendour.</p>

  and Franco-Flemish illumination is the manner in which certain modes of decoration survived with
  very little alteration for more than a century. Thus we find the blue, red and gold diapers used

  href="#Nt_131"><sup>[131]</sup></a>, which had been fully developed before the middle of the

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Costly Horae.</i></span>The Franco-Flemish manuscripts of the
  fifteenth century were in some cases remarkable for the amazing amount of laborious illumination
  and the enormous number of miniatures which they contain. Some of these, which were executed for
  Royal or Princely patrons and liberal paymasters, engaged the incessant labour of the illuminator
  for many years. In these cases he was usually paid a regular salary, and so was relieved from the
  incentive to hasty work which caused so much inferior illumination to be produced in the fifteenth
  century.</p>

  Regent of France from 1422 to 1435<a id="NtA_133" href="#Nt_133"><sup>[133]</sup></a>. This
  wonderful manuscript, in addition to countless elaborate initials, and borders round every page,
  contains more than 2500 miniature paintings, all delicately and richly executed in burnished gold
  and brilliant colours, with backgrounds, in many cases, of the fourteenth century type, with
  chess-board <span class="pagenum" id="page136">{136}</span>patterns and other diapers of the most
  elaborate and sumptuous kind. The figures are of the finest Franco-Flemish style, showing the
  influence of the Van Eycks, who were then becoming the most skilful painters, technically at
  least, in the world.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>The Bedford Missal.</i></span>Another no less famous manuscript is the
  <i>Bedford Missal</i> in the British Museum, which was painted for the Duke of Bedford, and was
  presented by his wife to Henry VI. of England, when he was crowned King of France in Paris in the
  year 1430. The <i>Bedford Missal</i> contains no less than fifty-nine large miniatures and about a
  thousand smaller ones, not counting initials and borders. One point of special interest about this
  gorgeous manuscript is that the illuminations have evidently been executed by at least three
  different miniaturists, who represent three different schools, the Parisian-French, the
  Franco-Flemish and the English.</p>

  </table>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>MSS. by various hands.</i></span>It is by no means uncommon to find
  the work of several different illuminators in one manuscript. Naturally, when a wealthy patron
  ordered a magnificent book, he was not always willing to wait several years for its completion, as
  must have been necessary when the whole of a sumptuous manuscript was the work of one man.</p>

  <p>Again, it was not an uncommon thing for unfinished manuscripts to be sent to Bruges, Ghent and
  other centres of the illuminator's art from various distant towns and countries, especially from
  France, Italy and Spain, in order that they might be decorated with borders and miniatures by one
  of the Flemish miniaturists.</p>

  <p>In some cases it was only the miniature subjects which were left blank; so that we have the
  text with the illuminated borders and initials executed in the style of one country, while the
  miniatures are of another quite different school.</p>

  <p>Moreover, we find from the Guild records of Bruges that a certain number of Italian and Spanish
  scribes had taken up their residence in Bruges, and become members of the Guild of Saint John and
  Saint Luke, so that some manuscripts actually written in Flanders have a text which in style is
  Italian or Spanish.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page137">{137}</span></div>

  <p>Various other combinations of style occur not unfrequently. Many English manuscripts, for
  example, have miniature paintings which are French or Flemish in style, united with bold
  decorative borders of the most thoroughly English type.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>MSS. in Grisaille.</i></span><i>Manuscripts in Grisaille.</i> In
  addition to the illuminations glowing with gold and colour of jewel-like brilliance, a peculiar
  class of miniature painting came into use in France during the fourteenth century and to some
  extent lasted till the close of the fifteenth. This was a system of almost monochromatic painting
  in delicate bluish grey tints with high lights touched in with white or fluid gold; this is called
  painting in <i>grisaille</i> or <i>camaieu-gris</i><a id="NtA_134"
  href="#Nt_134"><sup>[134]</sup></a>; it frequently suggests the appearance of an onyx <i>cameo</i>
  or other delicate relief.</p>

  <p>The earliest examples of <i>grisaille</i>, dating from the first half of the fourteenth
  century, sometimes have grounds of the brilliant gold, red and blue diapers, the figures
  themselves being painted in <i>grisaille</i>; but in its fully developed form no accessories of
  colour are used, and no burnished gold is introduced, only the <i>mat</i>, glossless fluid gold
  being used in some cases for the high lights.</p>

  </table>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Delicacy of Grisaille.</i></span>Some of the miniatures of this class
  are extremely beautiful for the delicacy of their modelling and the great refinement of the
  design, and are evidently the work of artists of the highest class. This system of illumination,
  being unaided by the splendours of shining gold and bright colours, requires a rather special
  delicacy of treatment, and was of course quite unsuited for the cheap and gaudy manuscripts which
  were mere commercial products. In some cases the <i>grisaille</i> pictures are clearly the work of
  a different hand from the rest of the book, and thus we sometimes see them combined with richly
  illuminated initials and ivy-leaf borders of the usual gorgeously coloured type.</p>

  <p>In some late manuscripts the <i>grisaille</i> miniatures are distinctly intended to imitate
  actual bas-reliefs, and are <span class="pagenum" id="page138">{138}</span>painted with deceptive
  effects of roundness. This led to the introduction into manuscript ornaments of imitations of
  classical reliefs of gilt bronze or veined marbles, such as occur so often in the very
  sculpturesque paintings of the great Paduan, Andrea Mantegna.</p>

  the art of the illuminator had been mostly devoted to books on sacred subjects, but at this time
  manuscripts of <i>Chronicles</i>, accounts of <i>travel</i>, <i>Romances</i> and other secular
  works, often in the vulgar tongue, were largely written and illuminated in the most sumptuous way,
  especially for the royal personages of France and Burgundy.</p>

  <p>Philip the Bold of Burgundy, who died in 1404, was an enthusiastic patron of literature and of
  the miniaturists art; as was also Charles V. of France (1337-1380). A typical example of this
  school of manuscripts is a magnificent folio, formerly in the Perkins collection<a id="NtA_135"

  and verse written by Christina of Pisa<a id="NtA_136" href="#Nt_136"><sup>[136]</sup></a> about
  1390. This magnificent volume contains one hundred and fifteen delicately executed miniatures, the
  first of which represents Christina presenting her book to Philip of Burgundy.</p>

  The costumes, the internal fittings and furniture of rooms, views in the streets and in the

  countless other subjects are represented with much minuteness of detail and great realistic truth.
  We have in fact in the miniatures of this class of manuscripts the first beginning of an early
  school of <i>genre</i> painting, which in its poetic feeling and sense of real beauty ranks far
  higher than the ignoble realism of the later Dutch painters.</p>

  Latin <i>Chronicles of the World</i> beginning with the Creation and reaching down to recent
  times, written and illuminated with numerous miniature paintings on great rolls of parchment,
  often measuring from fifty to sixty feet in length. These are usually rather coarse in
  execution.</p>

  <p>Sir John Froissart's <i>Chronicles</i>, and their continuation from the year 1400 by Enguerrand

  of Sir John Mandeville, Marco Polo and others. This manuscript was written about the year 1412 for
  the Duke of Burgundy and was given by him to his uncle the Duc de Berri. Its numerous miniatures
  are very delicate and graceful, of elaborate pictorial style, with views of landscapes and
  carefully painted buildings, street scenes and other realistic backgrounds to the figure subjects,

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>MS. poems.</i></span>In the fourteenth century the growing love for

  manuscripts of works such as the <i>Quest of the Holy Grail</i>, including the whole series of the
  <i>Chansons de Geste</i> with the Lancelot and Arturian romances, the <i>Roman de la Rose</i>, one
  of the most popular productions of the fourteenth century, and a whole class of <i>Fabliaux</i> or
  short stories in verse dealing with subjects of chivalrous and romantic character.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Italian influence.</i></span>In southern France the style of
  manuscript illumination differed a good deal from that of the northern provinces. During the
  fourteenth century there was a considerable strain of Italian influence, partly due to the
  establishment of the Papal Court at Avignon, and the introduction there of Simone Martini or
  Memmi, and other painters from Florence and Siena, to decorate the walls of the Pope's Palace<a
  id="NtA_139" href="#Nt_139"><sup>[139]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>On the whole, however, manuscripts were not produced in such abundance or with such skill in
  southern France as they were in the north. Paris, Burgundy and the French districts of Flanders
  were the chief homes of the illuminator's art.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Secular miniaturists.</i></span>By this time the production of
  illuminated manuscripts ceased to be almost wholly in the hands of monastic scribes, as it had
  been in earlier days when manuscripts dealing with profane subjects were scarcely known.</p>

  <p>In Paris, Brussels, Antwerp, Bruges, Ghent, Arras and other French and Flemish cities, large
  classes of secular writers and illuminators of manuscripts grew up, and special guilds of
  illuminators were formed, exactly like the guilds of other arts and crafts<a id="NtA_140"

  <p>Before long this great extension of the art of illumination, and the fact that it became a
  trade, a method of earning a <span class="pagenum" id="page141">{141}</span>livelihood, like any
  other craft, led to a serious decadence in the art. Though wealthy patrons were able to pay large
  prices for richly illuminated manuscripts, thus keeping up the production of very elaborate and
  artistically valuable works of miniature art, yet the practical result was a growing decadence of
  style and workmanship.</p>

  <p>In most even of the best productions of the guild-scribes of the fifteenth century one sees

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Cheap MSS.</i></span>It is more especially in the cheap <i>Books of

  France, Flanders and Holland. Education had gradually been extended among various classes of
  laymen, and by the middle of the fifteenth century it appears to have been usual not only for all
  men above the rank of artisans to be able to read, but even women of the wealthy bourgeois class
  could make use of prayer-books. Hence arose a great demand for pictured <i>Books of Hours</i><a

  miniatures, which are <span class="pagenum" id="page142">{142}</span>often coarse in detail and

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Renaissance style.</i></span>At the end of the fifteenth century the
  influence of the classical Renaissance of art in Italy began to affect the French manuscript
  illuminations, and especially those by Parisian miniaturists. The introduction of architectural
  forms of Italian classic style into the backgrounds of miniatures was the first sign of this,
  examples of which occur as early as the year 1475 or 1480. Fig. <a href="#figure27">27</a> shows a
  characteristic example of a French miniature executed under Italian influence. This is a scene of
  the marriage of the B. V. Mary to the elderly Joseph, who holds in his hand the dry rod which had
  blossomed. One of the unsuccessful suitors is breaking his rod across his knee, as in Raphael's
  early <i>Sposalizio</i> in the Brera gallery at Milan.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Early printing.</i></span>A few words on the connection between early
  printing and the art of manuscript illumination may not here be out of place. The inventors of
  printing, Gutenberg, Fust and Schoeffer, appear to have had no idea of producing cheap books by
  their new art, but that for a fixed sum they could produce a more magnificent and beautiful book
  than a scribe could for the same price. Such a finished masterpiece of art as the <i>Mazarine
  Bible</i>, issued by Gutenberg in the year 1455, was not sold at a lower rate than the price of a
  manuscript Bible; but it was cheaper than a manuscript of equal splendour. <span
  class="leftmar"><i>The Mentz Psalter.</i></span>So also very few scribes of the fifteenth century
  could with the utmost labour have produced such a marvel of beauty as the <i>Mentz Psalter</i> of
  1559, printed on the finest vellum and illuminated with 280 large initials printed in blue and
  red&mdash;perfect marvels of technical skill in the perfect fit of the two colours, or
  <i>registration</i> as it is now called<a id="NtA_151" href="#Nt_151"><sup>[151]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>It is not known at what price this magnificent Psalter was originally sold, but existing
  records show that copies of the <i>Vulgate</i> produced in 1462 at Mentz by the same printers,
  Fust and Schoeffer, were sold in Paris for no less than sixty gold crowns, equal in modern value
  to double that number of sovereigns.</p>

  richly illuminated and historiated initials, which were frequently inserted by the most skilful
  miniaturists of the time. Thus the art of printing and illumination for more than half a century
  walked hand in hand. Some of the earliest printers had originally been illuminators of
  manuscripts, as, for example, Peter Schoeffer de Gernsheim<a id="NtA_152"

  as manuscripts, or that Fust was accused of having multiplied books by magical arts. The early
  printers usually inserted a statement in their <i>colophon</i> to the effect that the book was
  produced "without the aid of a pen (either of reed, quill or bronze), by a new and complicated
  invention of printing characters." Many different varieties of this statement occur.</p>

  <p>In the Mentz <i>Psalter</i> printed by Fust and Schoeffer in 1459 the printer's statement at

  initiated a new and cheaper form of book by the printing of his Virgil in small 12mo. size, with a

  and other sacred scenes, averaging in size three inches by two inches and a quarter. These

  <p>These block-book illustrations were coloured by hand in a very decorative and effective way,
  very superior to the coarse gaudy painting in opaque pigments with which the Parisian illuminators
  so often spoilt the exquisite miniatures and the borders in the vellum-printed <i>Horae</i>. The
  block-books are not painted over with <i>opaque</i> pigment, but delicately washed in with
  <i>transparent</i> tints, without obliterating the outlines of the printed pictures, which, though

  Byzantine illuminators first lost its vitality and then rapidly deteriorated, so in Italy the late
  surviving classical style of miniature became weaker and weaker in drawing, feebler in touch, and
  duller in composition, till in the eleventh and twelfth century a very low stage of degradation
  was reached, at the very period when the illuminator's art in more northern countries was growing
  into the most vigorous development of power and decorative beauty.</p>

  <p>The great Renaissance of art in Italy, which led to such magnificent results in the fourteenth
  to the sixteenth centuries, in its first beginnings lagged behind the artistic movement in the
  north, so that during the thirteenth century, when England, France and Germany had almost reached

  <p>Later on in the twelfth century, and during the first half of the thirteenth century, art in

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>MSS. of northern Italy.</i></span>In the fifteenth century the
  manuscript art of central and northern Italy, especially Siena, Florence, Venice and Milan, rose
  to a pitch of beauty and perfection which left it quite without rival in any country in the world.
  As was the case in writing of the glories of such manuscripts as the French <i>Apocalypses</i> of
  the fourteenth century, words are inadequate to describe the refined beauty of the best Italian
  manuscripts of this period. As has been already pointed out Italy was late in beginning her
  artistic Renaissance; and now, just when the rest of Europe was sinking into a more or less <span
  class="pagenum" id="page191">{191}</span><span class="leftmar"><i>Renaissance in

  magnificent artistic periods that the world has ever seen<a id="NtA_184"
  href="#Nt_184"><sup>[184]</sup></a>. The manuscripts of this period are not unworthy of the
  general artistic glories of the time, and in some cases their technical qualities bear witness to
  an almost superhuman amount of dexterity and patience.</p>

  <p>During the first half of the century, by far the greater proportion of the manuscripts written
  in Italy were for ecclesiastical purposes. Among the most magnificent, but at the same time also
  the rarest, are folio manuscript <i>Pontificals</i><a id="NtA_185"
  href="#Nt_185"><sup>[185]</sup></a>, executed for wealthy ecclesiastics of Episcopal rank.</p>

  <i>Pontifical</i>, dating from early in the fifteenth century, in the library of the Fitzwilliam
  Museum, is of its kind, one of the most beautiful manuscripts in the world. The delicacy of
  execution of the figures and especially the faces is little short of miraculous, and the numerous
  historiated initials, each representing some episcopal act of Consecration or Benediction,
  scattered thickly all through the volume, are a remarkable proof of the patient, unwearied skill
  which through years of labour must have been devoted to this one superb volume.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Italian poems.</i></span>Among the illuminated manuscripts with
  secular texts the most important are copies of Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i>, the works of
  Boccaccio and the Poems of Petrarch. The first page of such works as these is usually richly
  decorated with a wide border of scroll foliage, studded with the usual gold bosses. Frequently
  small miniatures in medallion frames are set at intervals among the conventional leafage; <span
  class="leftmar"><i>The owner's arms.</i></span>and at the bottom is a shield to receive the
  owner's coat of arms, surrounded with a delicately painted leafy wreath, which is supported on
  each side by a graceful figure of a flying angel <span class="pagenum" id="page192">{192}</span>or
  Cupid<a id="NtA_186" href="#Nt_186"><sup>[186]</sup></a>. In many cases the shield is still left

  to insert his arms<a id="NtA_187" href="#Nt_187"><sup>[187]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>The painting of the wreath which surrounds the shield is usually very beautiful, and the two
  flying angels or <i>amorini</i> are models of grace. This motive of the wreath held by two flying
  figures was largely used by the Florentine sculptors of the fifteenth century, such as Ghiberti
  and Luca della Robbia; it was suggested by the similar design, of very inferior execution, which
  occurs on so many ancient Roman sarcophagi.</p>

  received as pay 4 gold ducats each monthly, of 10 Julii to the ducat, equal to about £20 in modern

  execution, the immense fertility of fancy in their design, and the utterly unsparing labour that
  was lavished on their production. Moreover the manuscripts of this earlier period, before their

  complete his task within a limited time in order to earn his daily bread. Food and clothing of a

  him spend so large a proportion of each day within the Choir of his monastic church. Thus it was
  that his work as an illuminator of manuscripts provided the one great relief from his otherwise
  grey and monotonous life, from which he turned to revel in every variety of fanciful shape and of

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Short hours of labour.</i></span>There is yet another of the
  conditions under which the monastic scribe worked which was not without important effect on the
  unvarying excellence of his work, and that was that he could never remain long enough at work, at
  any one time, for his hand or eye to get wearied. Owing to the constantly recurring Choir
  services, the <i>Seven Hours</i>, which he had to attend, the monastic scribe could probably never
  continue labouring at his illumination for more than about two hours at a time.</p>

  No colours bought of a dealer in a commercial age could ever equal in beauty or in durability the

  upon, combined to make the manuscripts of the pre-commercial period works of the most unvarying
  perfection of technique, unspeakably rich in the varied wealth of fancy shown in their decorative
  schemes, as well as in the minute detail of each part. The illuminated ornament in one place is
  concentrated into a gem-like miniature within the narrow limit of a small initial letter. At
  another place it spreads out into the splendour of a full-page picture, which swallows up most of
  the text, and covers the whole page with one mass of burnished gold and brilliant colour. Or
  again, springing from its roots in an illuminated capital, it grows over the margin and frames the
  text with a mass of richly designed and exquisitely graceful foliage.</p>

  <p>Every possible scheme of decoration is to be found in these manuscripts; but in all cases the
  illuminator is careful to make his painted ornament grow out of and form, as it were, an integral
  part of the written text, which thus becomes not merely a book ornamented with pictures, but is a
  close combination of writing and illumination, forming one harmonious whole in a united scheme of

  <p>In the sixteenth century, owing to the introduction of printed works, the books in the
  Benedictine monastery of Durham had become too numerous for the row of <i>almeries</i> along the
  north walk of the cloister to hold them; and so a separate room was provided as a second library.
  The present library at Durham is the old Dormitory or <i>Dorter</i> of the Monks with all its
  "cubicles" or <i>sleeping-carrels</i> removed.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Other monastic Scriptoria.</i></span>In the Houses of other religious
  foundations the arrangements for the writing of manuscripts were different from those of the
  Benedictines. In a Convent of Dominican Friars, for example, each friar worked in his own cell
  where he slept, and in a Carthusian monastery each monk had a complete little house and garden
  with a small study and oratory and a larger room, where his labours, literary or mechanical, were
  carried on.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Growth of Guilds.</i></span>Towards the latter part of the thirteenth
  and throughout the fourteenth century, secular artisans in all varieties of arts and crafts were
  gradually throwing off the bonds of the old feudal serfdom under which they had for long been
  bound. The growth in number and importance of the Trade-Guilds, which in England developed so
  rapidly under Henry III., was one of the chief signs of the growing importance of the artisans of
  the chief towns of this and other European countries.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Importance of the Trade-Guilds.</i></span>At the end of the thirteenth
  century, in London, in Florence, and in many other cities no man could possess the rights of a
  citizen and a share in the municipal government without becoming a member of one of the
  established Trade-Guilds. Edward I., Edward III. and others of the English Kings set the example
  of enrolling themselves as members of one of the London Guilds<a id="NtA_224"
  href="#Nt_224"><sup>[224]</sup></a>; and in Florence it was necessary for Dante to become a member

  as one of the <i>Priori</i>.</p>

  <p>At first the scribes and illuminators (<i>librorum scriptores et illuminatores</i><a

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Guilds in the XVth century.</i></span>By degrees the Guilds became
  more numerous and more specialized in character, till their fullest development was reached in the
  first half or middle of the fifteenth century. Much interesting information about the
  miniaturists' Guild in Bruges during the second half of the century has been published by Mr
  Weale<a id="NtA_228" href="#Nt_228"><sup>[228]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>This was the Guild of Saint John and Saint Luke; and every painter, miniaturist, illuminator,
  rubricator, copyist, maker of vellum, binder or seller of books who lived and worked in Bruges was
  obliged to belong to this Guild. This rule, which existed in Ghent, Antwerp and most artistic
  centres, had a double use; on the one hand it protected the individual illuminator from wrong and
  oppression of any kind; and, on the other hand, it tended to keep up a good standard of excellence
  in the work which was executed by the Guild-members.</p>

  </table>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Rules of the Guilds.</i></span>No miniaturist could be admitted till
  he had laid before the Dean of the Guild a sufficiently good sample of his skill, and all members
  were liable to be fined if they used inferior materials of any kind, such as impure gold,
  adulterated ultramarine or vermilion and the like. In this way the officers of the Guild acted as
  moderators between the artisan and his patrons, securing reasonable pay for the artist, and, in
  return for that, reasonably good workmanship for his employer or customer. The Guilds also
  prevented anything like commercial slave-driving by limiting very strictly the number of
  apprentices or workmen that each master might employ.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Decadence of MS. art.</i></span>Thus it happened that, though fine
  manuscripts were still written and illuminated in many of the principal monasteries of Europe, a
  large class of secular illuminators grew up, especially in Paris and the chief towns of Flanders
  and northern Germany. In this way the production of manuscripts, especially illuminated <i>Books
  of Hours</i>, became a regular commercial process, with the inevitable result that a great deal of
  work of a very inferior character was turned out to meet the rapidly growing demand for cheap and
  showy books.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page218">{218}</span></div>

  <p>An immense number of these cheap manuscript <i>Horae</i> were produced after a few fixed
  patterns, with some mechanical dulness of repetition in every border and miniature with which they
  were decorated.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Costly Horae.</i></span>At the same time manuscripts were still
  produced, mostly at the special order of some royal patron or wealthy merchant, which, in
  elaborate beauty and in unsparing labour of execution, are hardly surpassed by the work of the
  earlier monastic scribes<a id="NtA_229" href="#Nt_229"><sup>[229]</sup></a>. Examples of this are
  mentioned above at pages <a href="#page135">135</a> and <a href="#page169">169</a>.</p>

  <p>The Dukes of Burgundy and the Kings of France, towards the close of the fourteenth and the
  first half of the fifteenth century, numbered many illuminators among their regular paid
  adherents. In some cases the artist was permanently engaged, and passed his whole life in the
  service of one Prince; while in other cases famous illuminators were hired for a few months or
  years, when the patron wanted a specially magnificent manuscript either for his own use, or as a
  royal gift on the occasion of a marriage, a coronation or other great event.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Women artists.</i></span>In some cases, we find that women learnt to
  be manuscript illuminators of great skill and artistic taste. For example Cornelia, the wife of
  Gérard David of Bruges<a id="NtA_230" href="#Nt_230"><sup>[230]</sup></a>, was, like her husband,
  both an illuminator of manuscripts and a painter of altar retables. A fine triptych painted by
  Cornelia, in the possession of Mr H. Willett of Brighton, is a work of great beauty and
  refinement, which it would be difficult to distinguish from a painting by Gérard David
  himself.</p>

  id="NtA_231" href="#Nt_231"><sup>[231]</sup></a>. <span class="pagenum"
  id="page219">{219}</span>And large sums were often advanced by money-lenders or pawnbrokers on the

  the best Italian vellum of the fifteenth century.</p>

  <p>One occasional use of the very thin uterine vellum should be noted. For example in a German
  twelfth century copy of the <i>Vulgate</i>, now in the Corpus library in Cambridge, some of the
  miniature pictures have been painted on separate pieces of uterine vellum, and then pasted into
  their place on the thicker vellum pages of the manuscript. This, however, is an exceptional

  perfectly smooth and, in the case of the finest vellum, has a beautifully glossy texture like that
  of polished ivory.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Mode of making paper.</i></span>A very different process was used for
  the various kinds of paper which were made in mediaeval and modern times. The essence of the
  process consists in making a fine pulp of cotton or linen rags by long-continued pounding with
  water sufficient to give the mixture the consistency of thick cream. A handful of this fluid pulp
  is then spread evenly and thinly over the bottom of a fine wire sieve, through which the
  superfluous water drains away, leaving a thin, soft mass which is then turned out of the sieve,
  pressed, dried and finally soaked with size to make the paper fit to write on. This process leaves
  the wire-marks of the sieve indelibly printed on to the paper.</p>

  <p>These marks are of two kinds, <i>first</i>, those of the stouter wires which run longitudinally
  along the sieve at intervals of about an inch or a little more, and <i>secondly</i>, very fine
  cross wires, placed close together, and woven in at right angles to the first-mentioned stouter
  wires.</p>

  <i>water-marks</i> came into use, together with the invention of linen paper. Some simple device
  indicating the city or province where the paper was made was woven with fine wire into the bottom
  of the sieve, and this mark was impressed upon the paper, like that of the other (parallel) wires
  of the sieve. A double-headed eagle, a vase, a letter or a bull's head are among the earliest
  paper-marks which occur in manuscripts and books of the fifteenth century<a id="NtA_244"

  such as the <i>Book of Kells</i>, is largely due to the very skilful use of gold and silver. These
  metals were applied by the illuminator in two ways, <i>first</i>, as a fluid pigment, and
  <i>secondly</i> in the form of leaf.</p>

  <p>The fluid method appears to have been the older. It is easier to apply, but is not comparable
  in splendour of effect to the highly burnished leaf gold, which was used with such perfection of
  skill by the illuminators of the fourteenth century.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Method of grinding.</i></span><i>Fluid gold</i> was made by
  laboriously grinding the pure metal on a porphyry slab into the finest possible powder. This

  pigment; see Theophilus, <span class="smaller">I.</span> 30 to 33<a id="NtA_252"
  href="#Nt_252"><sup>[252]</sup></a>. When dry, it could be to some extent polished by burnishing,
  but as it was laid directly on to the comparatively uneven and yielding surface of the vellum it
  never received a very high polish. As a rule therefore fluid gold was left unburnished, and its
  surface remained dull or <i>mat</i> in appearance.</p>

  fifteenth century manuscripts a delicate diaper of scroll pattern is sometimes painted with a fine
  brush over a ground of burnished gold leaf.</p>

  <p>In the fifteenth century, during the decadence of the illuminator's art, the use of fluid gold,

  realistic borders in Flemish manuscripts<a id="NtA_253" href="#Nt_253"><sup>[253]</sup></a>, for
  touching in the high lights of miniatures, and for many other purposes. When used to cover large

  Cistercian Abbeys. In the dialogue between a Cistercian and a Cluniac monk, <i>De diversis
  utriusque ordinis observantiis</i> (<i>Thesaur. Nov. Anecdot.</i> Vol. <span

  painting large capitals with it"; <i>aurum molere et cum illo molito magnas capitales pingere
  litteras, quid est nisi inutile et otiosum opus</i>? St Bernard himself had an even stronger
  objection, not only to gold in manuscripts, but to any ornaments with grotesque dragons and

  splendour of effect produced by skilfully applied gold leaf depends mainly on the fact that it was
  laid, not directly on to the vellum, but on to a thick bed of a hard enamel-like substance, which
  gradually set (as it got dry) and formed a ground nearly as hard and smooth as glass; this enabled
  the gold leaf laid upon it to be burnished to the highest possible polish, till in fact the gold
  gave a reflexion like that of a mirror. This <span class="pagenum" id="page232">{232}</span><span
  class="leftmar"><i>Mordant ground.</i></span>enamel-like ground, or <i>mordant</i> as it was
  called, was commonly as thick as stout cardboard, and its edges were rounded off, which has the
  double result of making the gold leaf laid upon it look not like a thin leaf, but like a thick
  plate of gold<a id="NtA_254" href="#Nt_254"><sup>[254]</sup></a>, and at the same time the rounded

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Convex surface.</i></span>Thus, for example, the little bosses and

  manuscripts of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, are convex in shape, like an old-fashioned
  watch-glass, and each boss reflects a brilliant speck of light whatever the direction may be in
  which the light falls upon the page. Perhaps the most sumptuous use of gold leaf is to be seen in
  some of the early fourteenth century French manuscripts, in which large miniatures are painted
  with an unbroken background of solid-looking burnished gold, with a mirror-like power of
  reflexion.</p>

  <p>It was only by slow degrees that the illuminators reached the perfect technical skill of the

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Purity of the gold.</i></span>In the first place the purest gold had
  to be beaten out, not the alloy of gold, silver and copper which now is used for making the gold
  leaf of what is called "the finest quality." The English illuminators at the close of the
  thirteenth and in the fourteenth century frequently got their gold in the form of the beautiful
  florins of Florence, Lucca<a id="NtA_255" href="#Nt_255"><sup>[255]</sup></a> or Pisa, which were
  struck of absolutely pure gold<a id="NtA_256" href="#Nt_256"><sup>[256]</sup></a>. In England
  there was no gold coinage till the series of <i>nobles</i> was begun by Edward <span
  class="pagenum" id="page233">{233}</span>III.<a id="NtA_257" href="#Nt_257"><sup>[257]</sup></a>,
  but these were of quite pure gold, like the Italian florins, and so answered the purpose of the
  illuminator.</p>

  <p>Another important point was that the gold leaf was not beaten to one twentieth part of the
  extreme tenuity of the modern leaf. The leaves were very small, about three by four inches at the
  most, and not more than from fifty to a hundred of these were made out of the gold ducat of Italy,
  which weighed nearly as much as a modern sovereign<a id="NtA_258"
  href="#Nt_258"><sup>[258]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>In many cases, we find, the illuminator prepared his own gold leaf, and it was not uncommon for
  the crafts of the goldsmith and the illuminator to be practised by the same man. For example the
  Fitz-Othos, mentioned at page <a href="#page112">112</a> as a distinguished Anglo-Norman family of
  artists in the thirteenth century, were skilful both as makers of gold shrines and as illuminators
  of manuscripts. Many interesting notes about the Fitz-Othos and other artists employed at
  Westminster during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries are to be found among the royal
  accounts now preserved in the Record Office: see <i>Vetusta Monumenta</i>, Vol. <span
  class="smaller">VI.</span>, p. 1 seq.</p>

  <p>Among the accounts of the expenses of decorating with painting the royal chapel of Saint
  Stephen at Westminster in Edward III.'s reign, we find that John Lightgrave paid for six hundred
  leaves of gold at the rate of five shillings the hundred, equal to about £5 or £6 in modern value.
  And John "Tynbeter" received six shillings for six dozen leaves of tin used instead of silver, not
  because it was cheap, but because tin was not so liable to tarnish.</p>

  <p>These accounts are in Latin, which is not always of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page234">{234}</span>Ciceronian purity; a classical purist might perhaps carp at such phrases
  as these,</p>

  following year,</p>

  <p><i>Item. Unum scarletum blanketum</i>, ij<sup>s</sup> vij<sup>d</sup>.</p>

  <p>The scarlet blanket was not bought to keep the artist warm, but to make a red pigment from, as

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Goldsmith artists.</i></span>This close connection between the arts of
  the goldsmith and the illuminator had its parallel in other branches of the arts, and with results
  of very considerable importance. Many of the chief painters and sculptors of Italy, during the
  period of highest artistic development, were also skilful goldsmiths, as for example Ghiberti,
  Verrocchio, Ant. Pollaiuolo, Francesco Francia and many others.</p>

  <p>This habit of manipulating the precious metals gave neatness and precision of touch to the

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>The gold mordant.</i></span><i>The mordant.</i> We now come to the
  most difficult part of the illuminator's art, that of producing a ground for his gold leaf of the
  highest hardness and smoothness of surface. It is a subject dealt with at much length by all the
  chief writers on the technique of the illuminator, from Theophilus in the eleventh century, down
  to Cennino Cennini at the beginning of the fourteenth<a id="NtA_259"
  href="#Nt_259"><sup>[259]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Though differing in details, the general principle of the process is much the same in all; the
  finest possible sort of <i>gesso</i>, plaster, gypsum or whitening, was very finely ground to an
  impalpable powder, and then worked up with albumen or size to the consistency of cream, so that it
  could be applied with a brush. After the first coat was dry, a second and a third coat were added
  to bring up the mordant to the requisite thickness of body, so that it stood out in visible relief
  upon the surface of the vellum.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page235">{235}</span></div>

  <p>In order that the illuminator might see clearly where his brush was going, and keep his mordant
  accurately within the required outline, it was usual to add some colouring matter, such as bole
  Armeniac (red ochre), to the white <i>gesso</i>, which otherwise would not have shown out very
  clearly on the cream-white vellum. In many cases, however, this colouring matter is omitted.</p>

  </table>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Application of leaf.</i></span>When the last coat of the
  <i>gesso-mordant</i> was dry and hard, its surface was carefully polished with the burnisher and
  it was then ready to receive the gold leaf; several days' waiting would often be required before
  the whole body of the mordant had set perfectly hard. White of egg was then lightly brushed over
  the whole of the raised mordant, and while the albumen was still moist and sticky, the illuminator
  gently slid on to it the piece of gold leaf, which he had previously cut approximately to the
  required shape. He then softly dabbed the gold leaf with a pad or bunch of wool, till it had
  completely adhered to the sticky mordant, working it with special care so as completely to cover
  the rounded edges. After the albumen was quite dry, and the gold leaf firmly fixed in its place,
  the artist brushed away with a stiff brush all the superfluous gold leaf; all the leaf, that is,
  under which there was no mordant-ground to hold it fast.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Burnishing process.</i></span>The gold was then ready to be polished.
  For this purpose various forms of burnisher were used, the best being a hard highly polished
  rounded pencil of crystal or stone, such as haematite, agate, chalcedony and the like; or in lack
  of those, the highly enamelled tooth of a dog, cat, rat or other carnivorous animal was nearly as
  good<a id="NtA_260" href="#Nt_260"><sup>[260]</sup></a>. In fact patience and labour were the
  chief requisites; one receipt, in Jehan le Begue's manuscript, § 192<a id="NtA_261"
  href="#Nt_261"><sup>[261]</sup></a>, directs the illuminator to burnish and to go on burnishing
  till the sweat runs down his forehead. But caution, as well as labour, was required; it was very
  easy to scratch holes in the gold leaf, so that the mordant showed through, unless great care was
  used in the rubbing. In that case the illuminator had to apply another <span class="pagenum"
  id="page236">{236}</span>piece of leaf to cover up the scratches, and do his burnishing over
  again. To secure the highest polish, illuminators burnished the hard mordant as described above
  before laying on the gold leaf. In most cases two layers of gold leaf were applied, and sometimes
  even more, in order to insure a perfect and unbroken surface.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Application of gold.</i></span>All writers speak of this burnishing as
  being a very difficult and uncertain process even to a skilled hand, requiring exactly the right
  temperature and amount of moisture in the air, or else it was liable to go wrong. If the gold was
  to be applied in minute or intricate patterns the illuminator did not attempt to cut his leaf to
  fit the mordant-ground, but laid it in little patches so as to cover a portion of the ornament.
  The superfluous gold between the lines of the pattern was then brushed away, as the leaf only
  remained where it was held by the mordant. With all possible care and skill, it was hardly
  possible always to ensure a sharp clean outline to each patch of gold; and so one commonly finds
  that the illuminator has added a black outline round the edge of each patch of gold, in order to
  conceal any little raggedness of the edge.</p>

  yet not brittle substance, capable of receiving a polish like that of marble, and forming the best
  possible ground to receive the gold leaf. Much of its excellence depended on the patience of the
  illuminator in applying it in very thin coats; each of which was allowed to dry completely before
  the next was laid on. When ready to receive the gold leaf, after the burnishing of the mordant was
  finished, some purified white of egg was brushed over to make the gold leaf adhere firmly so as
  not to work loose or tear under the friction of the burnisher.</p>

  <p>Giovanni da Modena, a Bolognese illuminator, gives the following receipt for a different
  gold-mordant to be used with oil instead of albumen or size<a id="NtA_263"

  mastic varnish.</p>

  <p>This variety of mordant appears to have been used in a good many fifteenth century Italian
  manuscripts. It is not such a good mixture as the <i>gesso</i> and white of egg, as the oil used

  punches, which stamped dots or circles; these, when grouped together, formed little rosettes or
  powderings, like those used in the panel paintings of the same time. Gold treated in this way had
  to be of considerable thickness, and in some cases, when a large flat surface of mordant was to be
  gilt, as many as three layers of stout gold leaf were employed to give the requisite body of
  metal.</p>

  to rub a bit of pure gold over the rough surface, which ground off and held a sufficient amount of

  painting a fresco<a id="NtA_270" href="#Nt_270"><sup>[270]</sup></a>. The Prior was in despair at
  the enormous amount of pigment that the thirsty wall sucked in, and he was agreeably surprised
  when, at the conclusion of the work, Perugino returned to him a large quantity of
  <i>ultramarine</i>, as a lesson that he should not suspect a gentleman of being a thief.</p>

  College, Cambridge, possesses a manuscript which affords a curious proof of the great value of
  ultramarine to the mediaeval illuminator. This is a magnificent copy of the <i>Vulgate</i> by a
  German scribe of the twelfth century, copiously illustrated with miniature pictures, many of which
  had backgrounds, either partially or wholly, covered with ultramarine. All through the book the
  ultramarine has in mediaeval times been very carefully and completely scraped off, no doubt for
  use in another manuscript. This theft has been accomplished with such skill that wonderfully
  little injury has been done to the beautiful illuminations, except, of course, the loss of
  splendour caused by the abstraction of the ultramarine.</p>

  some other blue pigments, lose much of their depth of colour if they are ground into very fine

  class="smaller">VII.</span> xi. 1) describes the method of making it by fusing in a crucible the
  materials for ordinary bottle-glass, mixed with a quantity of copper filings. The alcaline
  silicate of the glass frit acts upon the copper, which slowly combines with the glass, giving it a
  deep blue colour. The addition of a little oxide of tin turns it into an opaque blue enamel, which
  when cold was broken up with a hammer, and then powdered, but not too finely, in a mortar.</p>

  <p>Smalto blue is largely used for the simple blue initials which alternate with red ones in an
  immense number of manuscripts. The glittering particles of the powdered glass can easily be
  distinguished by a minute examination. Like the ultramarine, the smalto blue is always applied in
  a thick layer.</p>

  mosaics, which were so largely used by the Romans to decorate their walls and vaults, and then to
  pound them for use.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Method of using dyes.</i></span>Colours of all kinds prepared from
  vegetable or animal substances required a special treatment to fit them for use as pigments in
  solid or <i>tempera</i> painting. Though indigo and other colours of a similar class are the best
  and simplest of dyes for woven stuffs, yet they are too thin in body to use alone as pigments.
  Thus both in classical and mediaeval times these dye-pigments were prepared by making a small
  quantity of white earth, powdered chalk or the like absorb a large quantity of the thin dye, which
  thus was brought into a concentrated and solid, opaque form, not a mere stain as it would
  otherwise have been.</p>

  <p>These kinds of pigments are described by Pliny, <i>Hist. Nat.</i> <span

  Eraclius in his work on technique, <i>De artibus Romanorum</i>, calls them <i>colores
  infectivi</i>, "dyed colours," an accurately expressive phrase.</p>

  <p>One method, occasionally used for the cheaper class of manuscripts, was to paint on to the
  vellum with white lead, and then to colour it by repeated application of a brush dipped in the
  thin dye-pigment. Many of the colours mentioned below belong to this class.</p>

  called it <i>haematita</i>, <i>lapis amatista</i> or <i>amatito</i>, hence an ordinary lead pencil
  is now called either <i>lapis</i> or <i>matita</i> in Italy. This stone is quite different from
  the hard <i>haematite</i> which was used in classical times for the early cylinder-signets of

  text and the illuminations were done on loose sheets of vellum, which could be conveniently pinned
  down flat on the desk or drawing-board.</p>

  <p>The processes employed in the execution of an illuminated manuscript of the fourteenth or
  fifteenth century were the following;</p>

  <p><i>First</i>, if the text were to be in one column, four lines were ruled marking the
  boundaries of the patch of text and the margin. These four lines usually cross at the angles and
  are carried to the extreme edge of the vellum<a id="NtA_287"

  </table>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Ruled lines.</i></span>Next, the scribe, with a pair of dividers or
  compasses, pricked out at even distances the number of lines which were to be ruled to serve as a
  guide in writing the text. These pricked holes were, as a rule, set at the extreme edge of the
  vellum, and were intended to be cut off by the binder, but in many manuscripts they still remain.
  The scribe then filled the space within the first four marginal lines with parallel ruled lines at
  the intervals indicated by the pricks at the edge.</p>

  <table class="sp2 handonly ba" title="Sidenote" summary="Sidenote">
    <tr>
      <td><i>Stilus lines.</i></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Stilus lines.</i></span>In early manuscripts the guiding lines to keep
  the text even are usually ruled, not with colour or ink, but simply traced with a pointed
  <i>stilus</i>, which made a sufficiently clear impressed line on the vellum, showing through from
  one side to the other.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Lead lines.</i></span>In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the
  practice began of ruling the lines with a <i>lead point</i>; and then, from the fourteenth century
  onwards, they were usually ruled with bright red pigment<a id="NtA_288"
  href="#Nt_288"><sup>[288]</sup></a>; this has a very decorative effect in lighting up the mass of
  black text, <span class="leftmar"><i>Red lines.</i></span>and thus we find in many early printed

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>The plain text.</i></span>The next stage in the work was the writing
  of the plain black text. In early times it appears to have been usual, or at least not uncommon,
  for the same hand to write the text and add the painted illuminations, but when the production of
  illuminated manuscripts came mostly into secular hands, the trades of the scribe and the
  illuminator were usually practised by different people; and in late times a further division still
  took place, and the miniaturist frequently became separated from the decorative illuminator.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Guiding letters.</i></span>Thus we find that in many manuscripts the
  scribe has introduced in the blank spaces minute guiding letters<a id="NtA_290"
  href="#Nt_290"><sup>[290]</sup></a> to tell the illuminator what each initial was to be, and,
  especially in fifteenth century Italian manuscripts, instructions are added for the miniaturist,
  telling him what the subject of each picture was to be. These instructions were commonly written
  on the edge of the page so that they were cut off by the binder, but in many cases they still
  exist, not obliterated by the subsequent painting.</p>

  <p>But to return to the progress of the page, when the scribe had finished the plain text, leaving
  the necessary blank spaces for the illuminated capitals and miniatures, the work of decoration
  then began.</p>

    <tr>

    </tr>
  </table>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Decoration.</i></span>As a rule the decorative foliage and the like
  was finished before the separate miniatures, if there were any, were begun. First the illuminator
  lightly sketched in outline the design of the ornament, using a lead point. Next, wherever
  burnished gold was to be introduced, the thick mordant-ground was laid on; the gold leaf was then
  applied and finished with tooling and burnishing.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Gold leaf.</i></span>The reason why the gold was applied before any of
  the painting was begun was this; the long rubbing with the <span class="pagenum"
  id="page255">{255}</span>burnisher acted not only on the gold leaf, but also naturally rubbed the
  vellum a little way all round it. This would have smudged the painting round the gold if it had
  been applied first. Moreover, the burnisher was liable to carry small particles of gold on to the
  surrounding vellum, which would have given a ragged look to the design, if the adjacent surfaces
  had not been subsequently covered with pigment. In cases where there is an isolated gold boss
  there is usually a slight disfigurement from the burnisher rubbing the vellum all round the gold.
  In these cases the outline of the gold was made clean and definite by the addition of a strong
  black outline, as is mentioned above.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>The painting.</i></span>When the whole of the burnished gold was

  and sketched in for the manuscripts but previously used outline patterns were transferred on to
  the vellum by a bone <i>stilus</i> and ordinary transfer paper, made by rubbing red chalk all over
  its surface.</p>

  <p>In some of the better class of manuscripts with the "ivy-leaf" border, the illuminator has made
  the general design of one page serve for the next one in this way; when he had drawn in the main
  lines of the scroll-pattern on the borders of one page, he held the vellum up to the light and so
  was able to trace the pattern through from the other side of the leaf. To prevent monotony he
  varied the design by introducing different little blossoms among the repeated scroll-work which
  formed the main pattern.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Common bindings.</i></span>The commonest form of binding was to make
  the covers of stout oak boards, which were covered with parchment, calf-skin, pig-skin or some
  other leather. Five brass or bronze bosses were fixed on each cover, arranged thus <img
  src="images/bosses.png" style="width:0.9em;" alt=":·:"/> and two or four stout clasps made of
  leather straps with brass catches were firmly nailed on to the oak. The angles of the covers were
  often strengthened by brass or <i>latten</i> cornerpieces, and in some cases metal edgings were
  nailed all along <span class="pagenum" id="page258">{258}</span>the edges of the oak, making a
  very strong, massive and heavy volume. Large pieces of rock crystal, amethyst or other common gem
  were frequently set in the five bosses of the covers. These were always cut in rounded form <i>en

  transparent slice of horn, fixed with little brass nails.</p>

  <p>This appears to have been the usual system as long as books were kept in coffers or
  <i>armaria</i>; but when open bookshelves with chained books came into use, about the time when
  printing was invented, the title of a book was usually written on the front edges of the
  leaves.</p>

  <p>At that time books were set on the shelves in the opposite way to that now used, so that, not

  del Duomo</i>, are specially remarkable for their pictured bindings. These manuscripts date from
  about 1380 to 1410, one volume being devoted to the expenses and records of each year. On one of
  the covers of each is a large painting on the oak, frequently of a view of some part of Siena or
  of the interior of the Cathedral. Very interesting evidence with regard to the old fittings of the
  high altar, with Duccio di Buoninsegna's great retable, and the original position of the
  magnificent pulpit are given by some of these pictured covers. One volume of this Sienese series

  of the oak board; a method of decoration which was greatly elaborated and developed in the
  sixteenth century, especially by the German and Dutch bookbinders.</p>

  <p>The earlier stamped designs were of a much simpler character, usually consisting of powderings
  all over the surface of the cover, with small flowers or animals, such as lions, eagles, swans and
  dragons of heraldic character. In many cases these punches, or at least their designs, continued
  in use for a long time, and so one occasionally meets with a fifteenth century book, the binding
  of which is decorated with stamps of fourteenth or even thirteenth century style.</p>

  one punch or die; and the leather or parchment was softened by boiling so that a large surface
  could be embossed at one operation. This process was much aided by the invention of the
  screw-press, which enabled the workman to apply a steady and long-continued pressure. But in the

  times the operations of the binder and the manuscript illuminator had been carried on by the same
  man, or at least in the same workshop, so we find that some of the earliest English printers, such
  as Julian Notary, were also skilful binders of their own printed books. The very fine stamped
  bindings of Julian Notary and other English craftsmen are commonly decorated on one side with the
  Tudor arms and badges supported by angels, and on the other side with a pictorial scene of the
  Annunciation of the B. V. Mary with I. N. or other maker's initials.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Wallet bindings.</i></span>Returning now to the earlier bindings of
  manuscripts, we should mention one system which was frequently applied to <i>Books of Hours</i>,
  <i>Breviaries</i> (<i>portiforia</i>), and other <i>portable</i> books. This system was to extend
  the leather covering far beyond the edges of the wooden boards, which formed the main covers of
  the manuscripts, so that the book, edges and all were protected, very much as if it were kept in a
  bag. In fact this sort of binding really was a leather bag to the inside of which the book was
  attached.</p>

  <p>The mouth of the bag was closed by a running thong, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page261">{261}</span>a loop or some other fastening, and the book was thus carried about, hung
  from its owner's girdle<a id="NtA_298" href="#Nt_298"><sup>[298]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>In bindings of this class the leather covering was frequently dressed with the hair on. Corpus
  Christi College at Oxford possesses a very well-preserved example of this, a manuscript of the
  thirteenth century in a contemporary bag-covering made of deer's skin, with its soft brown fur in
  a perfect state of preservation.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Velvet.</i></span>Bindings of red or violet velvet were also
  frequently used for manuscripts. Plain red velvet, with elaborate clasps and corner-pieces of
  chased gold or silver, was perhaps the most usual form of binding for costly manuscripts of the
  fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Fine gems, especially the carbuncle and turquoise, were set in
  the gold mounts of some of these princely books.</p>

  the pages of manuscripts. A fine green dye and other colours were also used for vellum bindings.
  The Vatican records of books borrowed (and returned) usually mention how each volume was bound.
  Among the earliest of these records, dating from the Pontificate of Leo X. (1513 to 1522) the
  commonest descriptions of bindings are <i>in tabulis</i>, <i>in rubio</i>, <i>in albo</i>, <i>in
  nigro</i>, and <i>in gilbo</i>, indicating the colour of the skin or velvet in which the

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Later bindings.</i></span>In the sixteenth century, when private
  luxury and pomp were taking the place of the earlier religious feelings and beliefs which had so
  greatly fostered the decorative arts, bindings as costly as those of the <i>Altar-textus</i> of
  the great Cathedral and Abbey churches were again made at the command of wealthy patrons. Thus,
  for example, Cardinal Grimani had his famous <i>Breviary</i><a id="NtA_299"
  href="#Nt_299"><sup>[299]</sup></a> bound in crimson velvet, the greater part of which is
  concealed by the most elaborate <span class="pagenum" id="page262">{262}</span><span
  class="leftmar"><i>Gold mounts.</i></span>mounts, clasps, corner-pieces and borders of solid gold,
  of the most exquisite workmanship, decorated with a medallion portrait head of the Cardinal
  himself.</p>

  <p>So also the very similar <i>Horae</i> of Albert of Brandenburg<a id="NtA_300"
  href="#Nt_300"><sup>[300]</sup></a> is decorated with clasps and other mounts of pure gold; and an
  immense number of other sumptuous bindings, rich with embossed and chased gold, studded with
  precious gems, were made to enshrine the costly manuscripts of Giulio Clovio and other famous
  miniaturists of the sixteenth century period of decadence.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Bindings of needlework.</i></span>At the close of the fifteenth
  century or rather earlier, the custom became popular of having <i>Horae</i> and other manuscripts
  owned by wealthy secular personages bound in velvet, richly decorated with embroidery in gold and
  silver thread and silk mixed with a great number of seed pearls. The arms, badges and initials of
  the owner are the commonest designs for these embroideries.</p>

  <p>Some of the German examples of this class of binding are especially elaborate and magnificent;
  but on the whole this method of decoration is not at all suited for covering books.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Works on bindings.</i></span>With regard to books on the subject of
  early bindings; it is much to be regretted that existing works, of which there are a great many,
  especially in French, all begin just about the period when bindings of the greatest interest and
  the truest artistic value were no longer made. Plenty has been written about the costly bindings
  in which Grolier, Maioli, and other wealthy book-buyers had their purchases encased, but no work
  exists on the bindings of the mediaeval period, when, frequently, the covers of a manuscript were
  as much a labour of love as the illuminated pages within. The sixteenth century binders, who
  worked for Grolier and other rich patrons of art, lived at the verge of a commercial epoch, and
  though their works are often very pretty and technically of high merit, yet they cannot be
  compared, as true works of art, with the bindings of the period before printing was invented.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Small cost of MSS.</i></span><i>The present value of illuminated
  manuscripts.</i> On the whole a fine manuscript may be regarded as about the cheapest work of art
  of bygone days that can now be purchased by an appreciative collector. Many of the finest and most
  perfectly preserved manuscripts which now come into the market are actually sold for smaller sums
  than they would have cost when they were new, in spite of the great additional value and interest
  which they have gained from their antiquity and comparative rarity.</p>

  <p>For example, a beautiful and perfectly preserved historiated Anglo-Norman <i>Vulgate</i> of the
  thirteenth century, with its full number of eighty-two pictured initials, written on between six
  and seven hundred leaves of the finest uterine vellum, can now commonly be purchased for from £30
  to £40. This hardly represents the original value of the vellum on which the manuscript is
  written.</p>

  <p>Manuscripts of a simpler character, however beautifully written, if they are merely decorated
  with blue and red initials, commonly sell for considerably less than the original cost of their
  vellum<a id="NtA_301" href="#Nt_301"><sup>[301]</sup></a>.</p>

  <p>Again, the more costly manuscripts of fine style, which now fetch several hundred pounds,
  usually contain a wealth of pictorial decoration and laborious execution far in excess of that
  which could be purchased for a similar sum in any other branch of art.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Want of taste.</i></span>Another noticeable point is that the modern
  pecuniary values of manuscripts, even those which are bought only as works of art, are by no means
  in proportion to their real artistic merits. Manuscripts of the finest period of the illuminator's
  art, the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, are now sold for very much smaller sums than the
  immeasurably inferior but more showy and over-elaborated manuscripts of the period of decadence in
  the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.</p>

  <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Modern want of taste.</i></span>A melancholy example of the existing
  want of taste and lack of appreciation of what is beautiful in art is afforded by the fact that
  such a thing as a manuscript signed and illuminated by Giulio Clovio would fetch a far larger sum
  than so perfect a masterpiece of poetic art as a fine example of a fourteenth century Anglo-Norman
  <i>Apocalypse</i>.</p>

  <p>So also the late and inferior <i>Horae</i> of about 1480 to 1510 often sell for much higher
  prices than simpler but far more beautiful manuscripts of earlier date. Of course I am here
  speaking of the values of manuscripts regarded simply as works of art, not of those which are
  mainly of importance from the interest of their text.</p>

  <p class="sp5">The result of this is that a collector with some real knowledge and appreciation of
  what is artistically fine can perhaps lay out his money to greater advantage in the purchase of
  manuscripts than by buying works of art of any other class, either mediaeval or modern.</p>

  <p>The following excellent description of the chief kinds of Service-books which were used during
  the later mediæval period was originally written in 1881 by Henry Bradshaw, the Cambridge
  University Librarian, for <i>The Chronicles of All Saints' Church, Derby</i>, by the Rev. J. C.
  Cox and Mr W. H. St John Hope. It is by the kind permission of Mr Cox and Mr Hope that I am able
  to reprint Mr Bradshaw's valuable note, which, with admirable clearness and conciseness, explains
  the character of each of the principal classes of Service-books used in English Churches and the
  manner in which these books became differentiated and multiplied down to the time of the
  Reformation.</p>

    Churchyard Cross or a subordinate Altar in the Church; the only relic (in common use) of the

    This concentration or compression of the Services into one book is the natural result of time,

    <p><span class="leftmar"><i>Procession Services.</i></span>2. The Procession Services were
    contained in the <i>Processionale</i> or <i>Processionarium</i>. It will be remembered that the
    Rubric in our "Prayer-Book" concerning the Anthem ("In Quires and places where they sing, here
    followeth the Anthem") is <i>indicative</i> rather than <i>imperative</i>, and that it was first
    added in 1662. It states a fact; and, no doubt, when processions were abolished, with the altars
    to which they were made, Cathedral Choirs would have found themselves in considerable danger of
    being swept away also, had they not made a stand, and been content to sing the Processional
    Anthem without moving from their position in the Choir. This alone sufficed to carry on the
    tradition; and looked upon in this way the modern Anthem Book of our Cathedral and Collegiate
    Churches, and the Hymn Book of our parish Churches, are the only legitimate successors of the
    old <i>Processionale</i>. It must be borne in mind, also, that the Morning and Evening Anthems
    in our "Prayer-Book" do not correspond to one another so closely as might at first sight appear
    to be the case. The Morning Anthem comes immediately before the Litany which precedes the
    Communion Service, and corresponds to the Processional Anthem or Respond sung at the <span
    class="pagenum" id="page269">{269}</span>churchyard procession before Mass. The Evening Anthem,
    on the other hand, follows the third Collect, and corresponds to the Processional Anthem or
    Respond sung "<i>eundo et redeundo</i>," in going to, and returning from, some subordinate altar
    in the church at the close of Vespers.</p>

    </table>
    <p><span class="leftmar"><i>The Mass.</i></span>3. The Mass, which we call the Communion
    Service, was contained in the <i>Missale</i>, so far as the text was concerned. The Epistles and
    Gospels, being read at separate lecterns, would often be written in separate books, called
    <i>Epistolaria</i> and <i>Evangeliaria</i>. The musical portions of the Altar Service were
    latterly all contained in the <i>Graduale</i> or Grayle, so called from one of the principal
    elements being the <i>Responsorium Graduale</i> or Respond to the <i>Lectio Epistolae</i>. In
    earlier times, these musical portions of the Missal Service were commonly contained in two
    separate books, the <i>Graduale</i> and the <i>Troparium</i>. The <i>Graduale</i>, being in fact
    the <i>Antiphonarium</i> of the Altar Service (as indeed it was called in the earliest times),
    contained all the passages of Scripture, varying according to the season and day, which served
    as Introits (<i>Antiphonae et Psalmi ad Introitum</i>) before the Collects, as Gradual Responds
    or Graduals to the Epistle, as <i>Alleluia</i> versicles before the Gospel, as <i>Offertoria</i>
    at the time of the first oblation, and as <i>Communiones</i> at the time of the reception of the
    consecrated elements. The <i>Troparium</i> contained the <i>Tropi</i>, or preliminary tags to
    the Introits; the Kyries; the <i>Gloria in excelsis</i>; the Sequences or <i>Prosae ad
    Sequentiam</i> before the Gospel; the <i>Credo in unum</i>; the <i>Sanctus</i> and
    <i>Benedictus</i>; and the <i>Agnus Dei</i>; all, in early times, liable to have insertions or
    <i>farsuræ</i> of their own, according to the season or day, which, however, were almost wholly
    swept away (except those of the <i>Kyrie</i>) by the beginning of the thirteenth century. Even
    in Lyndewode's time (<span class="smaller">A.D.</span> 1433), the <i>Troparium</i> was explained
    to be a book containing merely the Sequences before the Gospel at Mass, so completely had the
    other elements then disappeared or become incorporated in the <i>Graduale</i>. This definition
    of the <i>Troparium</i> is the more necessary, because so many <i>old</i> church inventories yet
    remain, which contain books, even at the time of writing the inventory long since disused, so
    that the lists would be unintelligible without some such explanation.</p>

    they concerned a priest, were of course more numerous in old days than now, and included the
    ceremonies for <i>Candle</i>mas, <i>Ash</i> Wednesday, <i>Palm</i> Sunday, &amp;c., <span
    class="pagenum" id="page270">{270}</span>besides what were formerly known as the Sacramental
    Services. The book which contained these was in England called the <i>Manuale</i>, while on the
    Continent the name <i>Rituale</i> is more common. No church could well be without one of these.
    The purely episcopal offices were contained in the <i>Liber pontificalis</i> or Pontifical, for
    which an ordinary church would have no need.</p>

    there was another, absolutely necessary for the right understanding and definite use of those
    already mentioned. This was the <i>Ordinale</i>, or book containing the general rules relating
    to the <i>Ordo divini servitii</i>. It is the <i>Ordinarius</i> or <i>Breviarius</i> of many
    Continental churches. Its method was to go through the year and show what was to be done; what
    days were to take precedence of others; and how, under such circumstances, the details of the
    conflicting Services were to be dealt with. The basis of such a book would be either the
    well-known Sarum <i>Consuetudinarium</i>, called after St. Osmund, but really drawn up in the
    first quarter of the thirteenth century, the Lincoln <i>Consuetudinarium</i> belonging to the
    middle of the same century, or other such book. By the end of the fifteenth century Clement
    Maydeston's <i>Directorium Sacerdotum</i>, or Priests' Guide, had superseded all such books, and
    came itself to be called the Sarum <i>Ordinale</i>, until, about 1508, the shorter Ordinal,
    under the name of <i>Pica Sarum</i>, "the rules called the Pie," having been cut up and

    kitchen fire might be used for melting the wax on the tablets, so that a fresh list of names
    could be written (see above, p. <a href="#page8">8</a>), for liquefying frozen ink, and for
    drying the vellum skins ready for writing on.</p>

    <p>A good deal of what is said in this section with regard to the technique of classical
    manuscripts will apply also to manuscripts of the mediaeval period. Many of the processes had

    Middle Ages through a study of various classical writers on pigments and the like, especially
    Pliny and Vitruvius.</p>

    <p>The words <i>parchment</i> and <i>vellum</i> are used vaguely to imply many different kinds
    of skins. Strictly speaking <i>vellum</i> implies calf-skin, but the word is commonly used to
    denote the finer and smoother qualities of skin; the name <i>parchment</i> being given to the
    coarse varieties; see Peignot, <i>L'histoire du parchemin</i>, Paris, 1812.</p>

    <p>The mere gold of even the finest Byzantine manuscripts is never as sumptuous or as highly
    burnished as that in manuscripts of the fourteenth century, owing to its being usually applied

    <p>In early times and indeed throughout the whole mediaeval period very few objects of any kind
    were placed upon the High Altar even in the most magnificently furnished churches.  In addition
    to the chalice and paten, and the <i>Textus</i>, the only ornaments usually allowed were a small
    crucifix and two candlesticks. The modern system of crowding the <i>mensa</i> of the altar with
    many candles and flowers did not come in till after the Reformation.</p>
    <p>In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the <i>Pax</i> was usually a separate thing, of
    more convenient size and weight than the heavy, gold-covered <i>Textus</i>.</p>

    many cases identical with those of the twelfth and thirteenth century mosaics in Saint Mark's at

    <p>This <i>Psalter</i>, which is now in the public library at Utrecht, may possibly be one of
    the very manuscripts which Canute brought from abroad. It was certainly in England for many
    centuries before it passed into the possession of Sir Robert Cotton, from whose library it must
    have been stolen, else it would have passed into the library of the British Museum along with
    the rest of the great Cotton collection of manuscripts.</p>
    <p>The <i>Utrecht Psalter</i> has been thought to be the work of an Anglo-Saxon artist, but,
    most probably, it is the work of a French scribe, though the miniatures are mainly of the
    debased classical style of Rome, and the character of the writing is even more distinctly
    classical, differing very little in fact from that of the fourth century Virgil of the Vatican

    invention of the designer.</p>

    <p>Fra Angelico's works were executed throughout the first half of the fifteenth century. Vasari

  <div class="foot">
    <a class="fnote" id="Nt_182" href="#NtA_182">[182]</a>
    <p>This is very doubtful. Fra Angelico's brother Fra Benedetto da Fiesole was a scribe rather
    than a miniaturist, and probably only wrote the fine large text; the illuminations were probably
    added by a pupil of Fra Angelico, named Zanobi Strozzi, who died in 1468.</p>

    <a class="fnote" id="Nt_183" href="#NtA_183">[183]</a>
    <p>As an example of this I may mention Fra Angelico's system of painting the shadows of drapery
    in pure colour, using the same colour mixed with white for the rest of the folds. To some extent
    this method was used by the Sienese school of painting, which in other respects resembles in
    style the miniatures in illuminated manuscripts; see above, p. <a href="#page114">114</a>.</p>

    <p>The gold penny of Henry III. and the florin and its parts of Edward III. were only struck as
    patterns. The gold noble was first issued in 1341; its value was 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> or half a
    <i>mark</i>. So many nobles were destroyed to make gold leaf for illuminating, and for other
    purposes, that an Act was passed prohibiting, under severe penalties, the use of the gold
    coinage for any except monetary purposes.</p>

    <p>In Cennino's time, the early part of the fourteenth century, in Europe, sugar was sold by the

    Moslem countries cane sugar was made and used in comparatively large quantities throughout the
    mediaeval period; but in Europe it did not come into use as an article of food till the 16th

    <p>In mediaeval times this was done by first embedding the powdered stone in a lump of wax and

    <p>It should be remembered that a large number of the mediaeval receipts and processes were not

    <p>The use of litharge as a drier was one of the most important improvements made in the
    technique of oil painting by the Van Eycks of Bruges in the first half of the fifteenth century.
    Before then, oil paintings on walls had often been laboriously dried by holding charcoal
    braziers close to the surface of the picture. Among the accounts of the expenses of painting the
    Royal Palace of Westminster in the thirteenth century (see above, page <a
    href="#page110">110</a>) charcoal for this purpose is an important item in the cost. Paintings
    on panel, being moveable, were usually dried by being placed in the sun; but, in every way, a
    good drier like litharge answers better than heat, either of the fire or of sunshine.</p>

    <p>The vellum was not prepared in any way to receive the silver-point drawing; but when an
    artist wanted to make a finished study in silver-point he covered his vellum or paper with a
    priming of fine <i>gesso</i>, powdered marble, or wood-ashes; this gave a more biting surface to
    the paper, and made the silver rub off more easily and mark much more strongly. In the case of
    manuscript illuminations a strongly marked line was not needed, as the outline was only intended
    as a guide to the painter.</p>

    <p>Again, the first miniature in the French and Flemish <i>Horae</i> usually represents <i>Saint
